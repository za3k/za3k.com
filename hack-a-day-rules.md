Hack-A-Day is a challenge, in the same vein as NaNoWriMo, no-shave November, and many others. The idea is to make one new project each day (and optionally, post them somewhere for people to see).

Last year (2022), I set myself the challenge, and met it. I had a ton of fun, and make a lot of [cool video games and projects](https://za3k.com/hackaday) I can show off. This year I'm inviting the rest of the world to join me!

I'm a programmer, so I'm doing a new computer programming project every day. But I see no reason you can't do other kinds of projects.

## Rules

Here is how the challenge works:

- *In November 2023,*
    - **The challenge is in November 2023.** You're allowed to start late.
- *do one project a day,*
    - **You make at least 20 projects."** Get out a calendar and schedule time!
    - **You have to make an entire project, start to finish in one day.** You don't have to use the whole day. 1-4 hours a day should be enough time.
    - **You are allowed to work on anything you want.**
    - **You are not allowed to spend more than 1 day on a project.**
    - **You are not allowed to improve projects after the day is over.** Even after Hack-A-Day is over.
- *from scratch.*
    - **You are not allowed to work on existing projects.** (Programmers, that means NO bug fixes for an open-source project, adding features, or finishing up old stuff you have laying around. On the other hand, using libraries or frameworks is allowed and encouraged. You can even use ones you wrote *as long as you don't tinker on the libraries during Hack-A-Day*.)
    - **You are not allowed to work on or plan your project before the day.**
- *Challenge yourself*
    - **You should work on projects challenging to do in one day.**
- *but pace yourself*
    - **You are allowed to skip days.** But **you are not allowed to skip two days in a row**, or more than 10 days total.
    - **You do not have to successfully finish each project.** Only take on projects you *could* finish, but it's okay if you don't. It's better to try something fun and get 80% done, than to every day finish something lame you can definitely do in an hour.
    - **You can cheat a little!** The most important thing is to keep up the flow and stick to the spirit.
- *and have fun!*
    - **You should work on projects fun to do, fun to learn, or fun to show off.** Don't just pick something you can do, learn, or show off.
    - **You *can* share your projects if you want.** Feel free to share on social media of your choice, a blog, just show your friends, or to email me!

You can ignore any of the above rules if you don't like them. I'm not the boss of you! But since I am the only person that's done this challenge, I think I have good advice.

If you finish I will send you a little picture of a "2023 Hack-A-Day Complete" gold medal for being so cool and add your name to a list. I'll probably come up with a participation trophy too.

## Advice

Here is some additional *advice* from me.

- Tell people you're doing Hack-A-Day, and share your projects! It's fun, you get great feedback, and it's good accountability. But don't spend much time doing it.
- Try to make projects with a core and "stretch" goals. That way if you get 50% or 80% done with what you wanted, it will still be something cool.
- Don't skip 2 out of 3 days. You'll lose momentum.
- Brainstorm future projects every once in a while.
- Pay attention to which projects you're finding fun or not. I learned a lot about what makes me tick.
- Be flexible. Don't pick projects ahead of time. Go where your explorations take you.
- Set aside time for Hack-A-Day. Set aside time for *not* hacking, and hanging with friends or playing videogames :).
