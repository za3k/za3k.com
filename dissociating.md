Things that Dani remembers:

- Be nice and friendly
- Small sentences
- Lea is telling me something is wrong that we could change, not yelling at me.

Grounding exercises and stuff Dani wrote (also trying to be grounded, seperately):
- 0 to 10, how gone are you?
- Smells, looks, tastes, sees.
- "Can you tell me where you are and who I am?"
- Try hard to be not gone
- Where in body you're tense

Things that help with dissociating:

- Tell me your name, and details about yourself
- Look at me while you talk
- Check that I understand what you're saying to me.
- Being friendly, nice, reassuring.
- Asking 'x or y' questions. (yes or no, this or that)
- Ask me if I know where I am and who you are. Explain to me if I say no or am not sure.
- Do not suddenly leave me alone, explain why you are leaving.
- Remind me I am safe.
- Suggest I communicate by writing (I communicate more comfortably this way)
- Suggest (in the form of a question) simple tasks:
    - Can you do this?
    - Can you look at me?
    - Do you want some water?
- Asking if I can do a simple thing as opposed to telling me to do it. ("Are you able to calm down now?" instead of "calm down.")
- Asking "can I" and "can you" questions.
- Talking a lot makes me dissociate eventually, give me breaks where I don't have to speak or listen to you.
- Asking my level of dissociation (from 1-10) and if I know what caused it. (we can work on stopping what caused it if it's still happening)
- Helping me focus on the senses with things in the room I am in.
- Occasionally stopping to explain what's happening at the moment.
- I need to have the option to leave if I am anxious/ Having the option to move freely/do what I want.
