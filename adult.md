How to be an Adult
==================

People made being an adult seem scary and hard when I was a kid. Actually, a lot of people succeed at being an adult; this is because it's not hard and even dumb lazy people can do it. This is a list of what I think the minimum standards are I obey to be an "adult". I also explain what happens if you don't do them. My list assumes that you know how to use Google and are relatively smart (which is my target audience) and that you can make money reasonably easy (which might be totally wrong and unfair).

- Keep a reasonable level of hygiene, if you want other people to treat you reasonably. This is mostly about social presentability by smell and appearance, so if you want to stay in your house, health concerns are different. If you're not presentable, people may pretend you don't exist or have you kicked out of places. If you're a little unhygenic (pick your nose, smell bad) people might subtly not like you or avoid you.

    - Shower often (somewhere between daily and weekly is normal).
    - Change clothes somewhere between every day and three days.
    - Brush your teeth (mostly for health, although you can do things about bad breath).
    - Wash your clothes. You can wear them two or three times before you wash them, especially for pants, but it works better if you let them air out in between wearing them.
    - Haircuts. You don't have to go to a barber, but there's some kind of level of neatness you need.
- Go to the dentist and doctor at least once a year. You don't have to, but the less often you go, the worse problems can get and the more expensive/impossible they are to fix.
- Clean the place you live. Apparently this is not as mandatory as I think, but I think it's pretty great. I mean like, pick up things and wash dishes, nothing fancy. Vaccuum, maybe. I mostly get other people to do anything past that for me. If you don't clean for a long time, the most common problems are fungi, insects / bugs (ants and cockroaches), bad smells, and social costs ("ickiness").
- Go shopping sometimes (once a week / month depending if you want fresh food). You have to get like, food and things (well, if you eat at restaurants or order delivery you can almost get by without). If you don't like going outside, or live somewhere where you need a car and don't have one, you can get most stuff delivered by mail. A lot of the stuff you buy is once-per-house stuff like owning a plate, and then sometimes you run out of toilet paper / food / sponge is gross / you want things.
- Live somewhere. It's socially uncool to live with your parents. Pretty much anywhere else is fine, but most cost lots of money. For sucky reasons, it's actually illegal not to live in a house and live on the street / a car, so you can get into trouble. If you live with other people (parents especially), you might have to do other things to make them happy, so I advise not living with your parents or you'll end up grumpy and subservient all the time.
- Eat. What you have to eat is complicated but if you eat the "wrong" things no one else will care, and your body provides pretty good feedback if you're malnourished somehow.
- Get money somehow. This is needed to have a place to live, food, internet, etc. If you have more, you can do things like pay someone else to do things, or buy meals at restaurants, which can make stuff easier. This is basically the most important thing on this list, especially since I'm omitting a lot of things you "have to" do that actually just make life cheaper. It's a little unfair, but I want to write this based on my experience, and life is just a little easier as a programmer.
- Get a bank account. It's not completely mandatory, but close to. A lot of jobs will pay you by direct deposit or check, which is easier with a bank account. You also get checks (which are useful to mail money to places) and a debit/credit card, which you can use to buy things online.
- Keep important documents. These include licenses, insurance cards, medical records, bank cards, and tax records. They're variously inconvenient and expensive to replace, and not having them can make you liable for some things.
- Have medical insurance. If you don't, you have to pay more taxes. I pay more taxes. If I get in a medical emergency (I get really sick, etc) I'll be completely fucked.
- Register for the selective service if you're a male between the ages of 18-25.
- Do taxes once a year. This really isn't that hard as people make it out to be, especially if you have a normal job. If you work on your own for lots of people, or move between states a lot, it's a little worse. It's about 15-30% of your income. If you can't pay you can usually can get it delayed. You also don't have to pay anything if you don't make much money, you just have to file paperwork. It's illegal not to do taxes, and I think it's pretty hard to get out of.
- Jury duty. Not sure what happens there, it's a random selection thing and I've never been selected.
- If you want a car, it gets rid of a lot of problems (backup home, makes travel to/from work easier, etc).
    - Have a driver's license. This needs renewed every 5 years or so with your state, and requires taking a written test and a test where you have to drive.
    - Buy the car, and pay for gas and regular repairs. You can keep your car in good condition (it needs small amount of work as it gets older) or pay someone else to. I've never had maintainance work done on my car, I use the "hope" method. If it breaks I'll figure something out.
    - Register your car with the state DMV, which needs done once a year. This costs a few hundred dollars.
    - Have car insurance. If you don't, you can end up liable for damage when you're in an accident.

There's lots of negative obligations too (don't murder people, etc) but I'm not going to go into those, just what you do have to do.

I know that sounds like a lot, but that's it, it takes up maybe 15 minutes a day plus "eat" and "get money". And you can cut out parts if you want. But yeah, being an adult isn't as scary and hard as people make it out to be.

There's like, lots of other stuff you probably want to do to be a happy adult, but it's important to remember you get to decide what that is. You have all the rest of your time to figure that out, and you don't have to do what anyone else says if you don't want to.
