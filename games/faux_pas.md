## Supplies
Part of a deck of cards.
 - One each black 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
 - One each red A, J, Q, K. The red jack should be replaced with a red joker if available.

## The Teams
Each card is one person (role). You will be assigned a card in a second.

Black cards represent "our sort of people".
- Like any good members of high society, they have no interesting qualities whatsoever, and are identical except for rank.
- Society plays as a team. If any black player loses, the black team loses.
- The goal of the black team is to file into the ballroom, in order, from highest rank (card) to lowest.

Red cards represent "not our sort of people".
- Each red card is unique (see below).
- The red team wins together, but loses separately. If a red player loses, the rest of the red team plays on.
- The goal of the red team is simply to make the black team lose.

## The Setting
Draw a card at random WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT. Hold it to your head. This is your identity. Everyone knows it except for you.

There may be zero red cards, or multiple red cards.

You are at a high society ball, and everyone is unsure how they rank. Is the Ambassador of Korea announced before or after the Viscount of Andorra? Your goal is to politely mingle with other guests eating hors d'oeuvre in the anteroom, then enter the ballroom in correct order of rank.

## Entering the Ballroom
At any point, a player can announce, "I enter the ballroom.". They then start counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. If they reach 6, the black team loses.

Instead, another player should quickly announce "I too enter the ballroom", and begin counting, and so on.

After you reach 6, or if a player enters after you, lay down your card and look at it.

Once everyone has entered the room, the game is complete, and the black team wins.

## Faux Pas

If any player commits a faux pas, they lose and are out of the game. They look at their card. If they are a black player, their team has lost. If they are a red player, the game most likely continues.

When a faux pas is committed, announce it to the group. Once everyone agrees, then the player looks at their card.

- Entering the ballroom before a player of higher rank is a faux pas. This includes red players.
- Mentioning any number or card name is a faux pas (rules questions are fine)

## The Red Cards
- If the royal (K) commits a faux pas, the black team loses. Also, they rank above a 10, so entering before the royal is a faux pas.
- If the unwelcome guest (Q) enters the ballroom at all, they win and black loses. If they are the very last player remaining outside the ballroom, the black team shuts the door on them, leaving them outside.
- If the laughingstock (J) declares who they are, they win and black loses. The laughingstock is wild and can enter the ballroom in any position.
- If the false prophet (A) enters anywhere in the middle, black loses. They must enter either before all black cards, or after all black cards.

## Clarifications
- If someone enters before the false prophet (A), unwelcome guest (Q), or laughingstock (J) this is not a faux pas.
- If the royal (K) and the false prophet (A) are both in play, the false prophet must enter first or last, or black loses. The royal may enter second after the false prophet.
- If the unwelcome guest (Q) enters before the royal (K), this is a faux pas. The unwelcome guest drops out of the round, but the ballroom entrance immediately continues.
