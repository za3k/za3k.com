**how to play**
1. one player is the Secret-Haver, and the other player is the Guesser.
2. the Secret-Haver picks a secret the other people have to guess, like "cake". pick something really hard to guess, like "george washington's tenth birthday cake".
3. the Guesser asks yes-or-no questions ("is it an animal?"), and the Secret-Haver answers them ("no")
4. if the second player guesses the secret, they win.

**credits**
this game was probably designed by carl shulman (best guess) or anna salamon. it's explicitly designed to increase your frustration tolerance.
