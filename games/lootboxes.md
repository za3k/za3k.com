A short storytelling game for 2-4 players, best with 2. Play as long as you want, 10-30 minutes. It's a good time to kill time on a long drive.

### Rules
- Each player describes their character in one or two sentences. You can have a goal or not.
- You always have an inventory of exactly three items. Pick any three items to start. Don't think about them much.
- One player starts out as GM.
- The GM tags a player. They describes a challenging situation. For example the player's driver's license has expired but they need to get to the airport to pick up Rhianna. 
- The player describes how they solve the challenge using an item in their inventory. For example, they use their Grouch Marx disguise to blend in with the orcish army.
- The player always loses the item they used to solve the challenge--all items are one-use only.
- When a player beats the challenge, the GM rewards them with a loot item. Items can be totally random, or can relate to the challenge.
- After the player beats the challenge, they become the GM. They tag a new solver, and issues that player the next challenge.
- When it's getting boring, you stop getting new items--just use up your existing ones and end the game.
- **Variant**: You can have the same GM for every challenge and loot reward, rather than rotating.
- **Variant**: After the GM describes the challenge, one of the players can volunteer to solve it, rather than being tagged to solve it.
- **Variant**: When you succeed at a challenge, get two items, not one. Players start with only one item.
- **Variant**: Start with 5 items. Whenever you finish a challenge, throw an extra item you dislike out (each challenge you gain 1 item and lose 2). When you're out of items, the game is over.
