This a list, keeping track of whether different programs require one config file, support includes, or support directories directly.

Program           | Config file   | Support
---------------------------------------------
Bash              | ~/.bashrc     | Yes (includes with globbing)
OpenSSH           | ~/.ssh/config | Will be in (7.3)[https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1585]
