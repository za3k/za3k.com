The following is an archived version of Rich Burlew's worldbuilding and GMing guide. This used to be up on his site, [giantitp.com](http://www.giantitp.com/Gaming.html) [wayback](https://web.archive.org/web/20200216152147/http://www.giantitp.com/Gaming.html). I've archived it because it's currently down, and has been since 2020.

Rich, if you see this and would like me to take it down, I'd be happy to, just get in touch. I just think these are really great articles and would like them to stay available in one form or another.
