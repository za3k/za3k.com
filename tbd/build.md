# Character Creation
1. In general, **once you start rolling dice (attributes, HP, or starting GP), no takebacks**. If you don't like your rolls, tough. There is one exception--you can switch to the standard array for attributes.
1. Generally, if you want to make some changes to fit your character idea, ask! I'm pretty open to it, and while I might not always say yes, I'll at least offer an alternative. Anything aesthetic-only will almost certainly be approved (ex. changing spell descriptions without changing game effects, or changing what starting equipment looks like).
1. Add yourself on roll20. Ask the DM for a character sheet.
1. **Level**. Match the level the party is at. Check the discord for what that is.
1. **Attributes**. You may choose any of the following methods:
 1. Roll 4d6 six times, each time discarding the lowest die. Re-order however you want.
   - If you don't like your roll, you can switch to the standard array (but not point buy).
 1. Take the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
 1. Use standard point buy (27 points)
1. Allowed **classes and races**:
 - The Player's Handbook. You may use "variant human" if you want.
 - Volo's Guide to Monsters
 - Xanathar's Guide to Everything
 - Tasha's Cauldon of Everything. You can use custom lineage but I write "munchkin" in sharpie on your forehead.
 - NO: Artificer
 - Anything else, ask the group about balance. As a DM, I don't enjoy balancing, so I'm leaving it to the players to call the shots.
1. If you want to tweak your **background** or make a custom background, the answer is yes for anything in the standard "custom background" options, ask the group if you want to do anything else
1. **Languages**. Exotic languages like Celestial are allowed.
1. Starting **equipment**. At level 5+, ask the DM. Otherwise, choose any of the following methods. Then add 30gp.
  1. Take the suggested gear for your class and background
  2. Roll for gold as given in the player's handbook.
  3. Take the [average roll](average_gold) for your class as given in the player's handbook.
1. Write a **character bio**. Include
  - Why your character is adventuring at all, and why they're adventuring with the party in particular. What is their goal for the next week? The next three months?
  - What do they look like physically?
  - What is their personality like?
  - What's their backstory?
  - What people or organizations might they have ties with? Are the ties good (allies), bad (enemies), or neutral?
  - How do they know they're one of the Chosen Ones? Has it been handed down through generations of their family? Did they take a standardized test? Did a mysterious witch visit town and point out the alignment of the stars at their birth? Did they draw the short straw?
