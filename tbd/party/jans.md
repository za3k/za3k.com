- **Description**: 
        The offspring of a muse and a lightning deity, or so the rumors say, Jans spent a quiet childhood with his adoptive parents, nestled in Cadunn village among the wheat fields bordered by great oak trees, idling much of his free time away plucking the strings of an old guitar for anyone who would listen. Highwaymen and robbers were loathe to prey on travelers near Cadunn, for fear of the legend about a godling boy who called the storms and turned a bandit to ash.

        When the summons for the chosen one came to the village, they all knew there could be only one it was intended for. Jans gathered his belongings, said his goodbyes, and set out to meet his destiny, the wind at his back, and carrying with its breeze the sound of music that could only be described as... Electric.
