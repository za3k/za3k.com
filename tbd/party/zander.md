- **Physical Description**: 

> Zander is a skinny blonde haired elf with brown eyes and pale skin. He is on the shorter side when it comes to height (5'1) and you could say he dresses for comfort rather than style. He also has a moonstone necklace that he wears proudly that acts as a holy symbol that represents his faith to the Selûne, the goddess of the moon.

- **Backstory**: 

> Zander was born into a dark sinister cult, raised from birth to worship and serve as a follower of Zargon . From a young age, Zander was trained in the ways of stealth and deception, taught to use his skills to infiltrate and undermine his enemies. However, as he grew older, he began to question the cult's teachings and practices. He saw the evil that his people were capable of and knew that he could not continue to be a part of it.

> One night, Zander was tasked with infiltrating a rival cult to burn their temple to the ground because they were hiding an object that Zander's people considered heretical. He was well-trained and succeeded in infiltrating the temple, but once inside, something unexpected happened. Zander discovered that the rival cult was not what he had been led to believe. He saw that the rival cultists were actually just regular church people. Unlike the Zargon cultists, the followers of Selûne were kind, compassionate and provided guidance and medical attention to those who needed it.

> Feeling guilty for his past actions, Zander decided to reveal his true identity to the followers of Selûne and begged for forgiveness. The temple's head priest, seeing the elf's genuine remorse, accepted him with open arms. He learned Selûne's teachings and values and became a member of the temple with the responsability of protecting both the temple and its worshippers.

> Years passed, and everything seemed fine. The Zargon cultists, however, were biding their time to strike. They lured Zander away from the temple by having one of them disguised as an old farmer reach the temple for help moving his cattle. Zander and the three people he took with him to help were ambushed in the forest by the cultists. They fought back but only Zander managed to survive the attack.

> On his way back, he could see the orange glow of flames in the distance and as he got closer, he saw smoke coming out of the temple's windows and the front doors wide open. The crackling of the flames and the sound of wood splintering weren't loud enough to hide the cries of those trapped inside the temple.

> Trying to get a closer look, he could see benches engulfed in flames, the altar turned into a raging inferno and the roof collapsing. Beneath a fallen wooden pillar he found the head priest coughing, grasping for air. He tried to move the pillar out of the way but it was just too heavy for Zander.

> The head priest reached inside his garments and gave Zander a moonstone necklace and told him that this is what they were trying to destroy.  He gave him the necklace and asked him to keep it safe with his life and told him to look for Captain Bryce in the town's docks for help.

> Knowing that the cultists are hot on his trail and that its only a matter of time before they find him, Zander made his way to the town's docks, where he found Captain Bryce's sailor crew looking for an extra hand to help with the ship's voyage. Zander reached out to Captain Bryce and told him what had happened back at the temple. Looking closely at the necklace and then at Zander from top to bottom, this is what the captain said.

> "So, after all these years, you're Kronwikk's chosen? A bit scrawny in my opinion. My brother was a stubborn old man, wrong about a lot of things. But he knew his business, so I'll honor him by preparing you for your trip to Oracula."

> Zander joined Captain Bryce's crew as a deckhand and quickly adapts to the sailor way of life and became a valuable member of the crew. While on sea, the Captain taught him how to wield a sword in a way that didn't require the user to be strong and brawny, relying on speed, elegance and charm in equal parts instead.

> Almost one year later, after defeating him in a duel, Captain Bryce deemed Zander ready for what Oracula had in store for him. The elf and the crew shared a last drink before parting ways and the Captain told him that if things don't turn out to be good, the ship comes by Oracula once every year, that he'll always have a spot in the ship.

> Now, Zander is in a new place, wondering what the future holds for him.

> But what about his past? He is very far from Kronwikk, but the cultists have shown to be a very patient and determined group, willing to do anything to reach their goals. It will be a most dangerous journey, yes, but with Selûne's moonlight guiding his path, he is confident.
