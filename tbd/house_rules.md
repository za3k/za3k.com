# House Rules
- See [Character Creation](build) rules for allowed classes, races, and gods.
- Mostly we're using rules as written, nothing too crazy.
- We ARE using the optional flanking rule. If two PCs (or enemies) are directly opposite an opponent in melee, they get +2 pon melee to-hit rolls.
- We ARE using the optional feat rule.
- We ARE allowing multiclassing. (But limit of 2 classes.)
- We ARE NOT using the optional cleave rule.
- We ARE NOT using inspiration, healing surges, or hero points.
- Levels (will be added later)
- Skills
    - If the party is using one approach, they make one roll (assisting a player is still allowed of course). The entire party wouldn't roll separate perception checks to look for a secret door. If some players are in a library, but one is researching history and another is researching military tactics, they would make separate rolls.
    - If there is no time pressure (cooking, searching a room), you can choose to "take 10" and act like the die came up 10 instead of rolling.
    - If you have unlimited time and there's no penalty for failure (for example, carving a statue out of wood), you can "take 20" and act like the die came up 20. Your character can does the task carefully and takes much longer.
- Resting is harder during travel.
  - While adventuring in a city, the party will get a short rest for an hour break, and a long rest for sleeping overnight.
  - While travelling overland, the party will get nothing for an hour break, a short rest camping overnight, and a long rest for an extended break at an inn in a city. Normally one encounter a day would be the max while travelling, so this is to make things more interesting.
- Generally players are expected to track their own HP, rations, torches, encumbrance, etc.
- Magic effects may sometimes interact unexpectedly, for example drinking two potions at once, or casting levitate while on a flying broom.
- The wild magic sorcerer's surge table is boringly short for a core mechanic, so the DM will make up an effect or use a 10,000 effect web table.
- Magic Items
  - Magic items are not automatically identified after a rest. Players will need to study any found items in-game. Some will be easy to figure out, and some will be more difficult or require an Identify spell.
  - We ARE allowing players to craft their own magic items, including scrolls. Ask the DM to approve the item, and whether there are any special requirements beyond silver costs.
  - PCs can buy common and uncommon magic items. Buying rare magic items is possible but difficult. Very rare and above cannot be purchased.
  - Some wands (and other items with limited charges) recharge, and other don't. Player-created or store-bought wands do not recharge.
