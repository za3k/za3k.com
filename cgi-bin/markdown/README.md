Markdown Handler
================

This little script adds an Apache handler that lets you view Markdown
files with a .md extension more prettily on your webserver.

It's based on a PHP Markdown implementation by [Michel
Fortin](http://www.michelf.com/).


Installation
------------

* Copy .htaccess to your root, or update your httpd.conf file with its
  contents, if you prefer.
* Copy the markdown directory into your webroot.

Now visit a .md file on your webserver; you should see it as properly
styled HTML.
