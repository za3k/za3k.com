## About
The Senly Faye is home to the a tribe of halfings, who ride standing on the back of horses and buffalo; tieflings in the colder east, who care for enormous herds of yaks; and smaller groups of goat-herding humans. All three are nomadic.

## Government
The Senly Feye is a broad cross-tribal affiliation. The various tribes of the grasslands and tundra banded together for political purposes to deal with their neighbors, but operate independently. Actual formal government is done about once a year, in a large plain the nation has designated its "capitol". Most of the year it is kept empty, with only 4 foreign embassies.
