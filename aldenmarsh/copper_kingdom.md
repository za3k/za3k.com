## About
The Copper Kingdom is one enormous clan of copper dragonborn. A thousand years ago the emperors were copper dragons in human form. Modern emperors still claim to be, but they're really just copper dragonborn.
Non-dragonborn are faily common, but don't have full rights and usually work in service industries. The Copper Kingdom is fairly rich.

The Copper Kingdom is current engaged in naval and aerial war with another continent.
