- Day 32-34. Harvest festival. South (Ulaa) areas. "County Fair". Jungle gym set up for kiddies.
- Day 56. Whirling Festival. Named after a vine with seeds similar to maple helicopters. Food and performances during the day--dancing, juggling, and puppet shows. Water wrestling and "tree" climb contest. Spicy seafood street food (tandori octopus, blackened fish balls on a stick). Lanterns and pinwheels. Keeps going until late at night--fire-based performing and more sexy dancing after the kids are asleep.
