## Ranks
Aldish ranks are the same for infantry, cavalry, and sea.

The main ranks are:
- General commands an army or fleet (5000+ people)
- Commander commands a regiment (~1000 people)
- Captain commands a company (~100-200 people)
- Lieutenant commands a troop (~50 people)
- Sergeant commands a squad or group (~10 people)
- Non-officers: Corporal, Soldier, Cavalryman, Infantryman, etc

There are a great many exceptions for historical reasons or special jobs:
- Captain-at-arms, in charge of the house troops belonging to a baron or higher
- Grand Lieutenant Miner, in charge of siege weaponry and sapping for the entire army
- Huntsman Adjutant, in charge of a squadron of 10-20 non-humanoid monsters
- Mage Lieutenant, in charge of a "strike team" of magic-users.
- etc etc
