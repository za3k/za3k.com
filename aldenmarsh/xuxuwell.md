## About
Xuxuwell has two main areas. The north is more civilized, with some big cities. The cities are a few hundred years old, and are built in a Gothic style. They have known connection to the Hells, some scary history, scary places, and ruthless people living there. There's strong magic traditions in the cities, divine and arcane.

The countryside has tribes which have their own traditions. Some are nomadic, others aren't. There's dragons in the countryside.

Overall Xuxuwell doesn't have much of a central government--each city and tribe is fairly independent
