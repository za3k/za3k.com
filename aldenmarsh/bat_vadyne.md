## About
Bat Vadyne is the largest (arguably, only) settlement in the Wastes. It survives on a combination of sea trade and very limited agriculture. Living standards are subsistence-only. The population is mostly happy. Several heroes, major political figures, and philosophers are from Bat Vadyne. It houses a few monestaries.
