In Aldenmarsh, divination spells are prohibited by law--they are reserved for use by the Church of Baneth only. Spells are available for [sale](spell_sales.md) by the Church of Baneth.

There is no special magic in place to detect the use of these spells
- Normally, they would be detected in spellsbooks while going through customs at the border. It's common practice for spellcasters to cut out those pages before entering the country (and some less law-abiding ones may hide them or commit them to memory to write down after entry).
- A particularly showy use of divination magic, or what looks like divination magic, may be reported to the Steel.
