In [Aldenmarsh](aldenmarsh.md), divination spells are prohibited by law--they are reserved for use by the Church of [Baneth](baneth.md) only. 
- They're absolutely allowed in building your character they're only prohibited by the government in-game, not by the DM.
- Spells marked with * below are available for [sale](spell_sales.md) by the Church of Baneth.
- There is no special magic in place to detect the use of these spells. 
- Normally, they would be detected while going through customs at the border, by inspecting spellbooks. It's common practice for spellcasters to cut out those pages before entering the country (and some less law-abiding ones may take the pages with them, or memorize the spells to write on the other side of customs).
- A particularly showy use of divination magic, or what looks like divination magic, may be reported to the [Steel](baneth.md).
