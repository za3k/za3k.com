Aldenmarsh uses silver bits (cp), silver coins (sp), and silver rounds (gp)--silver coins in three sizes. Silver or gold bars are often used for very large sums of money. The coins are minted by the Silver Hall, and used everywhere in the region, not just Aldenmarsh.

In Aldenmarsh, gems are valuable but rarely used as money.
