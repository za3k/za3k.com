Domain: Knowledge / Any

Alignment: N

## Faith
Baneth is the God of True Seeing. Mortals first met him a millineum ago, though he has not appeared in Aldenmarsh in centuries. He is an undemanding god, simply watching, and occasionally granting gifts to those whose character or actions please him. He primary demand to his followers is to see the world as it is, with open eyes; turning aside falsehood, ignorance, and simplicity. His followers frequently will offer free education, especially in basic literacy and languages, and free libraries. Faithful priests might preach. They also might pursue greater insight on their own through worldly travel, scholarly research, or spiritual ritual.
Service is every [Light](days_of_week.md). Baneth religion involves many long speeches and elaborate rituals, as well as an emphasis on moral and social character. It plays down the role of action or prayer. His followers agree Baneth has not been seen walking the world for centuries.

Followers of Baneth like: literacy, education, and investigation
Followers dislike: willful ignorance, boasting, and self-deception
They have no strong opinions as a faith on secrets, illusions, or straightforwardness.

# Church
The Church of Baneth is mostly a political institution of Aldenmarsh. Everyone in Aldenmarsh is required to be a member of the church, and attend church service every Light day. However, actual strong attachment is Baneth and prayer is neither required or common in the population--maybe 20% of the population is actually faithful.

## Church (Governmental powers)
- Religious matters - The Church has total control over anything related to religious matters. It requires that foreign religion is always in tandem with, and below, worship of Baneth. It also prohibits [divination](divination.md) magic, heresy (which is something a religious scholar or preacher might commit), and blasphemy (worship of other gods as primary, or destruction of Church property). Deaths, and graves are religious business. Births and weddings are not.
- Council - The Church controls 4 of the 12 chairs on the counctil which runs Aldenmarsh. The Council can do anything, and also makes the laws of Aldenmarsh.
- Bureaucracy - The Church runs the civil service and bureaucracy. It regulates most permits, the purchase and sale of land, and controls the city coffers day-to-day. This is how the church makes the majority of its income, and exercises most political control.
- Steel Eye - The Church military, the Steel Eye, is the police arm of the law, especially in Canyonport. In the country, nobles may bring in criminals.
- Investigators - The investigators enforce the law. After a criminal is arrested, they determine the facts of the case, and whether the criminal is factually guilty of violating the law as written. The church does not sentence or determine the moral guilt of criminals.
- Education - The Gardeners control education, but the Church has a large input on the books taught.
- Tithe - Followers of Baneth tithe 1/7 of their income to the Church.

## Superstitions
- The truth always comes out on Light
- Ink is lucky. Couples about to get married will dip their fingers in ink the morning beforehand, and attendees will ask the couple to touch them and leave fingerprints.
- Baneth can see everywhere, but he is especially watching through his Eyes
- Lying is bad, but failing to spot a lie is also shameful

## Church Structure
Church structure is hierarchical, with local priests and bureaucrats at the bottom of the hierarchy, all the way up to the High Priests in Canyonport at the top. Control over Canyonport is tighter, while religious observances may be rarer and more relaxed in the country.

## Scripture
The sacred text is a single book, called the Holy Book of Baneth. There are a number of lesser tracts from the centuries, most of which are publicly available but considered unimportant and less canonical.

## Divine Magic
Spellcasting ability is rare, even in the priesthood--maybe 1 in 3 priests can cast 1st level spells.
Spells are available for sale from the church. Healing and Divination spells can be [purchased](spell_sales.md) in Canyonport and other major Church locations.
