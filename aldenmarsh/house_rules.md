# House Rules
- See [Character Creation](build) rules for allowed classes, races, and gods.
- Mostly we're using rules as written, nothing too crazy.
- We ARE using the optional flanking rule. If two PCs (or enemies) are directly opposite an opponent in melee, they get advantage on melee to-hit rolls.
- We ARE using the optional feat rule.
- We ARE allowing multiclassing. (But limit of 2 classes.)
- We ARE NOT using the optional cleave rule.
- We ARE NOT using inspiration, healing surges, or hero points. The "Lucky" feat is not allowed.
- Levels
    - Leveling is XP-based, not milestones. The DM will track it for the group. Generally XP is awarded for achieving goals the DM or party thinks are important, and most of it will be awarded for non-combat.
    - Leveling up is in-between sessions, to avoid a long interruption. You can roll your increased HP immediately for level 2 without waiting until the end of the session.
- Skills
    - If the party is using one approach, they make one roll (assisting a player is still allowed of course). The entire party wouldn't roll separate perception checks to look for a secret door. If some players are in a library, but one is researching history and another is researching military tactics, they would make separate rolls.
    - If there is no time pressure (cooking, searching a room), you can choose to "take 10" and act like the die came up 10 instead of rolling.
    - If you have unlimited time and there's no penalty for failure (for example, carving a statue out of wood), you can "take 20" and act like the die came up 20. Your character can does the task carefully and takes much longer.
    - "Law" checks are Int (History, Noble Education, or Religion, whichever is best)
- Resting is harder during travel.
  - While adventuring in a city, the party will get a short rest for an hour break, and a long rest for sleeping overnight.
  - While travelling overland, the party will get nothing for an hour break, a short rest camping overnight, and a long rest for an extended break at an inn in a city. Normally one encounter a day would be the max while travelling, so this is to make things more interesting.
- Generally players are expected to track their own HP, rations, torches, encumbrance, etc. Because of the non-standard currency, don't track currency weight for simplicity.
- Magic effects may sometimes interact unexpectedly, for example drinking two potions at once, or casting levitate while on a flying broom.
- The wild magic sorcerer's surge table is boringly short for a core mechanic, so the DM will make up an effect or use a 10,000 effect web table.
- Magic Items
  - Magic items are not automatically identified after a rest. Players will need to study any found items in-game. Some will be easy to figure out, and some will be more difficult or require an Identify spell.
  - We ARE allowing players to craft their own magic items, including scrolls. Ask the DM to approve the item, and whether there are any special requirements beyond silver costs.
  - In Canyonport, PCs [can buy common and some uncommon magic items](magic_items).
  - Selling magic items or buying rarer magic items will be difficult--even though Canyonport is the biggest metropolis around and a trading port, magic items are just rare!
  - Some wands (and other items with limited charges) recharge, and other don't. Player-created or store-bought wands do not recharge.
