= House Rules
- See [Character Creation](build.md) rules for allowed classes and races.
- We ARE using the optional **feat** rule. 
- We ARE NOT using the optional **flanking** rule
- Leveling: XP-based, not milestones. The DM will track it for the group.
- Gods: "Greyhawk" and "Nonhuman" gods listed in the back of the Player's Handbook. Plus [Baneth](baneth.md).
- You can use a "passive" roll for skill checks--just use 10 instead of rolling.
- Generally, if the party is using one approach, they make one roll (with advantage for assistance)--the entire party wouldn't roll perception checks to look for a secret door.
