Dear Master Eldon and Kipper,

Hello. I know it’s been a while since I last sent a letter. Things have been eventful from my end these last couple of weeks.

For starters, my progress on the tome had been delayed due to an unforeseen circumstance, but it may have led me to an opportunity to study it closer than first expected. I’ve also begun to figure out the meaning of the runes, and it does lead to an unusual type of magic. I’ve been able to “feel”, if I could best describe it, what I am assuming to be different events in time, and I can slightly alter it, for better or for worst. Also, the tomes contain a lot of the same runes that I found relate to time. I feel that whoever wrote this might of had access to time magic or maybe the simple layout of how it works. I am continuing to study and practice it whenever I have some free time to myself. I’ve been busy with other things.

So, I’ve recently begun work as an adventurer. It was a simple job and it paid plenty of gold. Well, it started as one job, but it looks like I may be getting other jobs soon. I’m about to go to another one the next day after writing this. Not sure how I feel about them yet. Was it like this when you two started adventuring?

I’m not alone in my adventures. I’ve been with this group of people. An interesting bunch they are. Not too sure if I’m used to them yet, though I had begun living with them. We meant during an event in Cayonport and we worked together to solve it and earn a good amount of silver. They’re a work in progress, though I think that also includes me as well. I’m sure that they’re good people.

There’s Cal, our leader. He’s quite serious and level-headed most of the time. Reminds me a bit of you Kipper. Honestly, I find him more akin to myself. He was one of the two who lead the group’s formation. Although slightly reluctant, I think he would be a good leader.

Elira is an interesting woman. Honestly, she’s too kind and generous for her own good at times. She tends to march to the beat of her own tune and it tends to be difficult for me to keep up at times. She also really tried to push me to join the group as well. Well, in the end, I did commit myself to joining the group.

Corvus is the large, silent type. He’s almost pure muscle, but I tell he has a gentle side. It’s sometimes difficult to get a full read on him. Honestly, if I want some peace and quiet, I may just hang out with him and read a book.

Lastly, there’s Becket. Becket is an interesting person. He also marches to the beat of his own tune, but in a way that is interesting to watch. I find myself admiring his freedom and will to do what he wants. He does reckless stuff at times and really likes his drink, but I feel like he’s truly himself. He honestly reminds me of Master Eldon, just without the focus on magic and riddles. I wanna see if I can learn from him or maybe find a bit of myself from him.

I think I’m starting to figure out what you guys were saying before I left. Not the complete picture, but something. I may figure it out once I spent more time with this group of people. Maybe it may help me figure out this tome. Anyways, this is what I have to report for now. I’ll try to write to you much sooner. Hope everything back home is fine and well, and the academy hasn’t blown up again. I’m also sending some souvenirs. Hope you like them.

Until Next,
From Zorrinn
