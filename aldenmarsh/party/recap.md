Zorinn and the party go to meet the chronurgist Eroan Jian, who finishes the last of Zorinn's book, and offers to take him as an apprentice long-term. The party then visits the Roughshade Monestary, with its world-famous library. They buy several books (including magic books, a map of the wastes, and some smut). and do some research.

Cal goes back to visit Eroan again, giving him a warning about hurting innocents.

Session 22: 2021-05-19

Becket more or less dropping out (for the forseeable future), Mackian joining.

The party leaves the Mirage of Dreams Inn and heads south. They run into some ruins, where they find strange shadows and lose their won shadows. Zorinn uses detect magic, and is blinded by the strength of the runes. They are some kind of coldbliss from the Arcane Flowering. They overshoot the Rifts to the west, and lose a little time. They rescue Makian, who had been hanging by his fingers on a ledge partway down a canyon. They cross using an ice bridge, and ignore the whispers and skeletons down the canyon. Continuing on, Makian spots a glowing cave, the hidden mushroom village his group had been looking for originally. The mushroom people seem friendly but the party and the mushroom people can't communicate, so they quickly leave.

The party reaches Va Popli in Bat Vadyne, where they immediately stop at the restaurant owned by their Watch contact, Barlar. They want to arrange some kind of tax structure, bu there's no centralized government. Barlar suggests finding a sponsor to pay the tax. They head to the workshop of Jescasti, a well-known philanthropist, who ends up buying the ewer of endless water outright instead. They party will send Va Popli a second decanter once it's made, from Canyonport.

Level 4 reached.

Session 21: 2021-05-12

The party talks to the orcs, but they end up fighting. The party is divided over whether attacking the orcs is legitimate, and fights amongst themselves. They bring the orc (Smelly) back to the town for the night, and make him lead them to his camp. He shows them a campfire, but the party threatens and beats him until he reveals the real orc warcamp, with 150 orcs and at least one giant wolf. They return to town, turning him over to the prison, and the guard runs off to tell someone about the warcamp. They try to get Neville at the Bracklehull Merchants Association to pay them without success.

They decide to leave for Bat Vadyne, and will travel by foot over the wastes (it will take 2-3 weeks). They stop by Fort Hydra to prepare, and set off after selling their horse and wagon. Four days in, they succcessfully find the Mirage of Dreams Inn, the last outpost before Bat Vadyne.

The current date is Year 722, Day 78 (Charity).

Session 20: 2021-05-05

The party talk to Grub and decided to go to Bat Vadyne to deliver them water. They shopped for magic items, finding some nice ones, and argued in- and out- of character about selling their iron ewer of endless water. They bought horses and a wagon, travelling  south to the Bracklehull Merchants' association, where they talk to an unhelpful secretary about recent orc attacks. They managed to find an attacked merchant, and got information that the attack happened north of Bracklehull. Disguising their wagon as merchants' wagon, they headed north, where they spotted orcs coming up on them.

Session 19: 2021-04-28

The party found the Black Oracle, but there was a scary shadow creature in there. They defeated the shadow, and asked all their given questions, plus one accidental one--deciding not to ask any of their own in favor of getting money. The party exited the name immediately for safety, paid their assistants, and received a bonus of a bag of holding. They have several letters offering work at the house.

Welcome to William Johnson.

The party fights a ghost, and wins. During the fight they meet a mysterious stranger, William Johnson, who assists. They retreat back to the mages' guild to rest and recuperate, where they calculate that at a cost of 4500sp each, they can heal only one person--they select Zorrinn. Four of the NPCs leave (some bitter about not being healed), and are replaced. The party returns to the maze and cautiously approaches what used to be an unconscious minotaur.

- Dodge will listen in on mute to games, and help with rules. Direct basic rules questions to him in PM, and I'll ask him questions in voice
