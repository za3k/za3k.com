## Printed Pamplet

**Truth** - "See what is, ignore what is not," these are the words of our Holy **Lord Baneth**. I will try to speak as plainly and briefly as possible, although it does not come naturally to me. The Church of **Baneth** has not seen **His** light in hundreds of years, although **His** eye watches us everywhere. We have strayed from his command. The Church has become a political institution, as is plain to any child. This is not a new change, but being old does not make something right. **Baneth** issued no special command to **His** priests to tell others what to do. We have no special guidance from Him, beyond our own dubious wisdom, protect us from hubris. It was not right to exert our will over the will of our follow citizens. It was not right, is not right, and it must stop. The Church must return from a political to a religious body.

**Charity** - The Church should offer free education to all. The Church, as much as possible, and it is possible today with no changes, should offer free healing to all.

**Patience** - The truth of **Baneth** will come to all in time. The Church must cut ties with the government immediately. It must relinquish control of its council seats. It mush relinquish the Steel for the use of the country, except a small force for the use of the Church. It must relinquish the Scriptoria.

**Silence** - The Church must remove that which is unneccessary. Sermons must be restricted only to scripture of His word and life. If needed, we will erect new churches in the country. The Doctrine of Primacy is not sciptoral and must be rejected.

**Loyalty** - The Gardeners, although they have provided a great service with their education to all, are not part of the Holy Church. The Church must cut ties with the Gardeners immediately. The Church must cut ties with the nobility of Aldenmarsh immediately.

**Light** - Above all else, we must re-establish conversation with **Baneth**.

**Family** - All have possibility in **Baneth**'s eyes. The Aldish Church of **Baneth** must become the Church of **Baneth**. Restrictions on non-Aldish priests must be lifted, and we will send missionaries abroad.

Aldenmarsh doesn't keep paperwork on citizenry, and long-term imprisonment is unheard of. If convicted of a major crime, the victim is visibly tattooed ("Marked") with their crime. If someone would get a third Mark they are executed.
