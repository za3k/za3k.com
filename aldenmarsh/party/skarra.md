Letters betweeen Cal and Sca

Jacob to Cal, Year 422 Day 73

```
Dear Cal,

I hope this letter finds you safe. I would have preferred to tell you such personal news crammed like fish in a barrel and not tossing it over a gulch, but I understand travel is difficult. This mail is safe from any wrong eyes.

I've briefly met your parents decades ago, though I didn't know them well. They were Neville and Linda Jorvik. Neville Jorvik was a knight from Lorille, who immigrated to Aldenmarsh. Linda Kingstone was noble, and her family disowned her for marrying Neville. Both were half elvish, knock on wood. Neville was in the Watch, and Linda joined afterwards. That's why the Watch made sure to raise you. Every detail we know about how who killed them, we know from asking you as a child. We looked through the house but didn't find any clear signs. I don't know any more than you do.

I will pass your message on to Scarra. I'm sure he will be proud.

-Jacob

Skarra to Cal, Year 422 Day 55

Dear Cal,

I won't be home, unfortunately. I'll be out fishing with Jacob on his boat for the next three weeks. It is the 51st of the year as I write this. But, you're welcome to stop by. I'd enjoy a spar, though I'm sure I'll regret it the morning after.

Congratulations on finding work. Congratulations also on your new allies. If they prove fast, perhaps you should introduce us. A friend of Cal is a friend of mine.

Stand strong with Baneth. Only fight when it upholds the peace--do not be too eager to strike down evil doers. None of us is perfect.

-Skarra
