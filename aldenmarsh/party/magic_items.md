In this campaign, several things are needed to make a magic item:
1. A magical formula. There is a special formula (like a recipe) to make each item.
2. Character level. Common and uncommon items require level 3, rare ithems level 5, very rare items level 11, and legendary items level 17.
3. Raw materials. Each item has components which are needed to assemble it. The components may be expensive, the number of attempts to create it may be high, or the PCs may need to hire experts to help them. The cost of the raw materials is essentially the cost of the item.
4. Labor. The players labor 8 hours a day, making 250sp (25gp) of progress per day. Once they put in the same amount of labor as the cost of materials, they complete the item. For higher-tier items, the DM will pick a labor time manually (by game rules it would be years, for NPCs).
5. Special conditions. Some items have special conditions--the player may need to cast specific spells each day, be of a certain race or class, or find exotic ingredients not available on the marketplace.

- Amulet of the Devout, +1, uncommon
    - Character Level Required: 3
    - Materials: 2500sp (250gp) of silver and labor from a silversmith. Usually several attempts are needed, and some silver is destroyed with each attempt.
    - Labor: 12 days
    - Special conditions: The creator must be a cleric or paladin. The holy symbol is for a particular god, the god of the creator.
    - Creation process. The creator prays day and night to their god, forging the amulet without ever stopping their prayers. The creator only needs to actually strike the amulet once a day--the physical work can be done by the silversmith with guidance from the creator, while the creator does the spiritual work. At the end of the process, a +2 or +3 amulet gradually shinks in size by a factor of ten or more, becoming tiny and exquisitly detailed.
