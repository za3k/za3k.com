## About
The wastes is a vast wasteland. It's dry, and mostly at high elevation. There are a few scattered settlements, as well as isolated houses, tents, and nomads. The only major city is Salzberg, an human and orcish salt mining town.

Parts of the wastes are claimed by other countries on paper, sometimes more than one, but no one actually lives there.
