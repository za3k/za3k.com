# Character Creation
1. **Once you start rolling dice (attributes, HP, or starting GP), no takebacks**. If you don't like your rolls, tough.
1. Generally, if you want to make some changes to fit your character idea, ask! I'm pretty open to it, and while I might not always say yes, I'll at least offer an alternative. Anything aesthetic-only will almost certainly be approved (ex. changing spell descriptions without changing game effects, or changing what starting equipment looks like).
1. Add yourself on roll20. Ask the DM for a character sheet (and character sheet for a familiar if needed)
1. **Attributes**. You may choose any of the following methods:
 1. Roll 4d6 six times, each time discarding the lowest die. Re-order however you want.
 1. Take the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
 1. Use standard point buy (27 points)
1. Allowed **classes and races** definitely include everything in the books listed below. For anything else, ask!
 - The Player's Handbook. You may use "variant human" if you want. Wild magic sorcerers will find surge effects at the DM's discretion.
 - Volo's Guide to Monsters
 - Xanathar's Guide to Everything
 - Tasha's Cauldon of Everything
1. If you want to tweak your **background** or make a custom background, the answer is yes for anything in the standard "custom background" options, ask me if you want to do anything else
1. **Languages**. All PCs get Aldish (the language of Aldenmarsh) for free, in addition to Common.
1. **Skill proficiencies**. "Intelligence (Noble Education)" is a homebrew skill available to characters who are nobility and may have been educated in Aldenmarsh or around the Magic Sea. It's basically like a classical education--good for fiting in with nobility or sounding educated, but not directly useful for anything. To take it, replace any one skill proficiency you have.
1. Starting **equipment**. You can choose any of the following methods.
  1. Take the suggested gear for your class and background
  2. Roll for gold as given in the player's handbook.
  3. Take the [average roll](average_gold.md) for your class as given in the player's handbook.
1. Write a **character bio**. Include
  - Why your character is adventuring at all, and why they're adventuring with the party in particular. What is their goal for the next week/month/year?
  - What do they look like physically?
  - What is their personality like?
  - What's their backstory. At least a paragraph, can me more.
  - What people or organizations might they have ties with? Are the ties good (allies), bad (enemies), or neutral?
  - Whether they are an Aldish citizen. You can choose to have been born in Aldenmarsh, have gotten citizenship later (rare), be here on a special visa that allows travel (rare, explain why), be here on a normal visa that requires you to sleep in the foreign quarter of Canyonport, or be here illegally and travelling freely. Keep in mind that "exotic" races (ones not in the PHB) are probably foreign, and will probably attract attention.
  - If you are an Aldish citizen, write down your god, and whether you go to the Church of Baneth--the default to the second should be yes. If you are a foreigner, write down the god you worship--agnostic is fine but take a look through the list instead of picking it out of laziness.
1. After your first play session, I also recommend making a backup character in case your PC dies. This doesn't have to be in roll20, but I'm happy to give you a sheet if you want one.
