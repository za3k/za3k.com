# Character Creation
1. **Once you start rolling dice (attributes, HP, or starting GP), no takebacks**. If you don't like your rolls, tough.
1. Generally, if you want to make some changes to fit your character idea, ask! I'm pretty open to it, and while I might not always say yes, I'll at least offer an alternative. Anything aesthetic-only will almost certainly be approved (ex. changing spell descriptions without changing game effects, or changing what starting equipment looks like).
1. Add yourself on roll20. Ask the DM for a character sheet (and character sheet for a familiar if needed)
1. **Level**. Match the level the party is at. Check the discord for what that is.
1. **Attributes**. You may choose any of the following methods:
 1. Roll 4d6 six times, each time discarding the lowest die. Re-order however you want.
 1. Take the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
 1. Use standard point buy (27 points)
1. Allowed **classes and races**:
 - The Player's Handbook. You may use "variant human" if you want.
 - Volo's Guide to Monsters
 - Xanathar's Guide to Everything
 - Tasha's Cauldon of Everything. You can use custom lineage but I write "munchkin" in sharpie on your forehead.
 - NO: Unearthed Arcana, Aarakocra, Artificer
 - Anything else, ask!
1. If you want to tweak your **background** or make a custom background, the answer is yes for anything in the standard "custom background" options, ask me if you want to do anything else
1. **Languages**. Exotic languages like Celestial are allowed.
 - (Aldenmarsh group) All PCs get Aldish (the language of Aldenmarsh) for free, in addition to Common. 
1. **Skill proficiencies**. 
 - (Aldenmarsh group) "Intelligence (Noble Education)" is a homebrew skill available to characters who are nobility and may have been educated in Aldenmarsh or around the Magic Sea. It's basically like a classical education--good for fiting in with nobility or sounding educated, but not directly useful for anything. To take it, replace any one skill proficiency you have.
1. Starting **equipment**. You can choose any of the following methods.
  1. Take the suggested gear for your class and background
  2. Roll for gold as given in the player's handbook.
  3. Take the [average roll](average_gold.md) for your class as given in the player's handbook.
1. Write a **character bio**. Include
  - Why your character is adventuring at all, and why they're adventuring with the party in particular. What is their goal for the next week? The next three months?
  - What do they look like physically?
  - What is their personality like?
  - What's their backstory?
  - What people or organizations might they have ties with? Are the ties good (allies), bad (enemies), or neutral?
  - (Aldenmarsh group) Citizenship status. Keep in mind that "exotic" races (ones not in the PHB) are probably foreign, and will probably attract attention. You can choose to be:
      - An Aldish citizen born in Aldenmarsh
      - Have gotten citizenship later (rare)
      - Be here on a special visa that allows travel (rare, explain why)
      - Be here on a normal visa. This requires you to sleep in the foreign quarter of Canyonport, effectively prohibiting leaving the city legally
      - Be here illegally, but travelling freely anyway. 
  - (Aldenmarsh group) Your god, and whether you attend the Church of [Baneth](baneth.md). [Aldenmarsh](aldenmarsh.md) is a theocracy with mandatory church attendance for citizens. Going to church doesn't mean you worship Baneth or even like him.
      - If you are an Aldish citizen, you almost certainly go to the Church of Baneth. You might like Baneth, worship another god, or be agnostic.
      - Many-to-most Aldish citizens worship Baneth
      - The allowed gods are Baneth, the Greyhawk gods, and the non-human gods. They are found at the back of your player's handbook in an appendix.
      - Agnostic (no god) is fine as a deliberate choice, but don't pick it as a default because you didn't look through options.
      - Clerics, paladins etc can't be agnostic. If you're a cleric or paladin, talk to the DM for a little extra help with your background and how you'll be treated.
1. After your first play session, I also recommend making a backup character in case your PC dies. This doesn't have to be in roll20, but I'm happy to give you a sheet if you want one.
