# About
## When and where
- Play is by voice on Discord, and on roll20. 
- Sessions are every week, same time same day.
    - Aldenmarsh: Meets every Wednesday from 6pm-10pm PST.
    - Xuxuwell: Meets every Tuesday from 6pm-10pm PST.
- We'll try and do a 15-minute break halfway
- Cancelled sessions will be rare but in the Discord if they happen.

## Expectations
- Show up every week and be on time
- If you can't show up, let us know ahead of time. We'll play with 3+ players. If you miss too many sessions I'll kick you out, sorry!
- Have your character ready for the first session
- Generally nothing is needed from players between sessions. Making one backup character (no bio needed) is recommended in case your PC dies.
- Have a copy of the D&D rules (PDF is fine) and know the gist of the rules.

## Other stuff
- All experience levels welcome, none to lots.
- Hopefully we'll be playing a while!
- Sessions are recorded. The recordings will never be posted anywhere, they're just for the DM.
- Session recaps are posted on the discord.
- Sessions
    - Aldenmarsh: Session zero was 2020-12-09. 
    - Xuxuwell: Session zero will be 2021-03-23.
