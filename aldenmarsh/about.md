== When and where
Sessions are every Wednesday at 6pm. Cancelled sessions will be rare but in the Discord if they happen.

Play is by voice on Discord, and on roll20. 

== Expectations
- Show up every week and be on time
- If you can't show up, let us know ahead of time. We'll play with 3+ players. If you miss too many sessions I'll kick you out, sorry!
- Generally nothing is needed from players between sessions once you have a character.
- Sessions are recorded. The recordings will never be posted anywhere, they're just for the DM.
- All experience levels welcome, none to lots. You do need to have a copy of the rule (PDF is fine) and learn how to play.
- Hopefully we'll be playing a while!
- Session zero was 2020-12-09. Session recaps are posted on the discord.
