# Hundred Wonders
The Hundred Wonders were created about 800 years ago, the same time arcane magic appeared in the world. The origins of most of them are uncertain--they appeared very suddenly, sometimes causing huge or violent change. The name is not literal--there is no complete list of wonders, but there are 50-200 of them in the world.

- [Magic Sea](magic_sea), a magically pure freshwater lake
- City of Shadows, a city with magically animated shadows. Everyone who visits loses their shadow permanently.

<!--
- Canyon of Reanimation. A canyon that re-animates anything dead thrown in it
- Altar of Life. Restores to life any recently dead person placed on it. In North Humlend.
- Tundra in the Wastes. A large area of freezing tundra in the middle of the otherwise very hot Wastes.
