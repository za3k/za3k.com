# Hundred Wonders
The Hundred Wonders were created about 800 years ago, the same time arcane magic appeared in the world. The origins of most of them are uncertain--they appeared very suddenly, sometimes causing huge or violent change. The name is not literal--there is no complete list of wonders, but there are 50-200 of them in the world.
