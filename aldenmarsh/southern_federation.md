## About
The Southern Humland Federation is made up of four monarchies: Yania, Leesque, Pendlend, and Rothia. The Federation wants South Daylia and Sharoque to join as well. The Southern Federation has a fair amount of migration and traffic across internal borders.

### Jaroni Islands
The Jaroni Islands, off the coast, have also joined the federation. They have a population of 5,000 and are too small to get an equal say.
