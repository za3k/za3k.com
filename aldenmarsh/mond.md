# About
Mond is a fairly large, industrialized country. It manufactures high-quality items, often at larger scales. Although it is at about the same technology level as Aldenmarsh, the technology is widespread, rather than being used only for a few large public projects or specialized goods. It is relatively mechanized--watermills and windmills may power log-cutting operations or transport minecarts.
