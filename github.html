<p>Currently no one has backed up github.com (aside from Github). This webpage is about progress toward that. If you have 150-200TB of disk space and really good internet, please <a href="https://za3k.com">contact me</a> about getting a copy of github.</p>

<h3>List of Respositories</h3>
I host some metadata about github's repositories. This includes a lot of basic data about the repository, but NOT the issues, any wiki, downloads, or the git repository:
<ul>
	<li><p>Full repository metadata is available in JSON format. The format is explained on the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-all-public-repositories">github API</a>.</p>
    <p>The files are available in batches of 10,000 at <pre>http://za3k.com/github/repos-&lt;X>0000-&lt;X+1>0000.json
http://za3k.com/github/repos-&lt;X>0000-&lt;X+1>0000.json.gz</pre>
    To download all files, run <pre>

for x in {0..100}; do \
  wget "http://za3k.com/github/repos-$((x*10000))-$(((x+1)*10000)).json.gz"; \
done
    </pre>
    The combined size of these files is 10G compressed, 100G uncompressed. Files are grouped by github's internal id; since some repositories are deleted or privated, each file contains less than 10,000 repositories.
</li>
	<li>You can grab greatly abbreviated metadata (recommended) as <a href="https://za3k.com/github/repos.json">JSON</a>. This includes the repository name and URL, a short description, whether it is a fork (and what of), and the approximate size of the repository.</li>
	<li>Finally, you can get a txt file of just the repo names: <a href="https://za3k.com/github/repos.txt">txt</a>.</li>
	<li>This data was downloaded using a <a href="https://github.com/za3k/github-backup">custom tool</a> I wrote. My tool gets the data from the github API v3, with as little modification as possible.</li>
</ul> 

<h3>List of Gists</h3>
<p>Metadata for gists is currently unavailable from github, but I'm working with them to make it public.</p>

<h3>Github Timeline</h3>
<p>The Events Timeline is emphemeral, and being successfully recorded by <a href="https://www.githubarchive.org">githubarchive.org</a>. A second person running the same program in case of downtime would be a plus.</p>

<h3>Estimates on archiving repositories</h3>
<p>I selected 1000 random repositories from the above list, removing 427 forks. I then checked out all repositories. The total size was 4.3G, with or without compression. It was around 3 GB for a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">shallow</a> checkout. If we assume forks take no space, this means an average github repository takes up 4.3M. Omitting the largest repositories may improve this estimate, but I didn't run further tests.</p>
<p>If there are 35,000,000 repositories on github at an average size of 4.3M each, that multiplies out to around 150TB data total for the git repositories.</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Github">Archive Team</a> has some information about github, and you probably should talk to them if you want to help back up github. We basically just don't have anyone with space--the technical issues are not too large.</li>
</ul>
