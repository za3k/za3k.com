<p>Currently no one has archived github.com. This webpage is about progress toward that.</p>

I host the metadata for the repositories:
<ul>
	<li>Full repository metadata is available in batches of 10,000 at <pre>http://za3k.com/github/repos-&lt;X>0000-&lt;X+1>0000.json
http://za3k.com/github/repos-&lt;X>0000-&lt;X+1>0000.json.gz</pre>
    To download all files, run <pre>

for x in {0..100}; do \
  wget "http://za3k.com/github/repos-$((x*10000))-$(((x+1)*10000)).json.gz"; \
done
    </pre>
    The files are around 10G compressed, 100G uncompressed.
</li>
	<li>You can grab greatly abbreviated metadata (recommended) as <a href="https://za3k.com/github/repos.json">JSON</a>.</li>
	<li>Finally, you can get a txt file of just the repo names: <a href="https://za3k.com/github/repos.txt">txt</a>.</li>
	<li>I got data on github repositories using a <a href="https://github.com/za3k/github-backup">custom tool</a> I wrote which uses the github API.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Metadata for gists is currently unavailable from github, but I'm working with them to make it public.</p>

Additional information:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.githubarchive.org">githubarchive.org</a> archives the public timeline of github.</li>
	<li><a href="http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Github">Archive Team</a> has some information about github, and you probably should talk to them if you want to archive github. We basically just don't have anyone with space.</li>
</ul>
