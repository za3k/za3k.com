Arch Linux runs on raspberry pi. The official installation method is [here](http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/raspberry-pi). A script to automate this is [on github](https://github.com/za3k/short-programs/blob/master/extract-alarmpi).

If you just want to download the image, it's [1GB](https://za3k.com/archlinux-raspberrypi-1G.img). You'll have to resize the linux partition yourself after putting it on an SD card.
