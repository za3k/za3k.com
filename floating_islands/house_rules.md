# House Rules
- See "Character Creation" below when making a character
- Mostly we're using rules as written, nothing too crazy.
- We ARE using the optional flanking rule. If two PCs (or enemies) are directly opposite an opponent in melee, they get advantage on melee to-hit rolls.
- We ARE using the optional feat rule.
- We ARE allowing multiclassing. (But limit of 2 classes.)
- We ARE NOT using the optional cleave rule.
- We ARE NOT using inspiration, healing surges, or hero points. The "Lucky" feat is not allowed.
- We are using MILESTONE levelling.
- Skills
    - Taking 10: If there is no time pressure (cooking, searching a room), you can choose to "take 10" and act like the die came up 10 instead of rolling.
    - Taking 20: If you have unlimited time and there's no penalty for failure (for example, carving a statue out of wood), you can "take 20" and act like the die came up 20. Your character can does the task carefully and takes much longer.
    - If the party is using one approach, they make one roll. The entire party won't roll separate perception checks to look for a secret door. If one person is checking the map for secrets, another is searching the bricks, and a third is interrogating goblins about the location of the vault, they'd make three rolls (one per approach).
- Generally players are expected to track their own HP, rations, torches, encumbrance, etc.
- Magic effects may sometimes interact unexpectedly, for example drinking two potions at once, or casting levitate while on a flying broom.
- The wild magic sorcerer's surge table is too short, so the DM will use a 10,000 effect web table or make up an effect.
- Players can use downtime to craft 25gp of items per day, as long as they possess the relevant skills, supplies, tools, and any needed workshop. The cost of supplies is half the cost of the finished item. The 25gp per day rate doubles at 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level.
- Magic Items
  - Magic items can be bought in friendly lands
  - Found magic items are not automatically identified after a rest. Players will need to cast Identify, or study any found items in-game. Most will be easy to figure out.
  - Players can craft magical items just like non-magical items.
    - Supplies cost is half of the finished product cost.
    - There is a spellcasting level requirement. 
        - Common (3rd level), starting time 4 days
        - Uncommon (3rd level), starting time 20 days
        - Rare (6th level), starting time 100 days
        - Very Rare (11th level), starting time 500 days
        - Legendary (17th level), starting time 1250 days
    - Non-spellcasters of the correct character level can also make +1 to +5 weapons, armors, and ammo.
    - Players must be able to cast any spells mentioned in the item description to make it.
  - Store-bought and player-created items with limited charges (wands, etc) don't recharge, but have 50% more charges (round down). Found items will usually recharge.

## Character Creation
1. **Once you start rolling dice (attributes, HP, or starting GP), no takebacks**. If you don't like your rolls, tough.
1. Generally, if you want to make some changes to fit your character idea, ask! I'm pretty open to it, and while I might not always say yes, I'll at least offer an alternative. Anything aesthetic-only will almost certainly be approved (ex. changing spell descriptions without changing game effects, or changing what starting equipment looks like).
1. Add yourself on roll20. Ask the DM for a character sheet (and character sheet for a familiar if needed)
1. **Level**. Match the level the party is at.
1. **Attributes**. You may choose any of the following methods:
 1. Roll 4d6 six times, each time discarding the lowest die. Re-order however you want.
 1. Take the standard array: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
 1. Use standard point buy (27 points)
1. Allowed **classes and races**:
 - The Player's Handbook. You may use "variant human" if you want.
 - Volo's Guide to Monsters
 - Xanathar's Guide to Everything
 - Tasha's Cauldon of Everything. You can use custom lineage.
 - YES: Artificer, Warforged
 - YES: Aarakocra
 - NO: Artillerist, Gunslinger (no gunpowder or guns please)
 - NO: Unearthed Arcana
 - Anything else, ask!
1. If you want to tweak your **background** or make a custom background, the answer is yes for anything in the standard "custom background" options, ask me if you want to do anything else
1. **Languages**: Standard. Exotic languages like Celestial are allowed.
1. **Skill proficiencies**: Standard
1. Starting **equipment**. Start with up to 50lb of nonmagical equipment, no price limits. Add one common magic item.
1. Write a **character bio**. Include
  - Why your character is adventuring at all, and why they're adventuring with the party in particular. What is their goal for the next week? The next three months?
  - Your character was summoned as an expert by the Pharoah. Why does he think they can help? Are they an expert in anything?
  - What do they look like physically?
  - What is their personality like?
  - What's their backstory?
  - What people or organizations might they have ties with? Are the ties good (allies), bad (enemies), or neutral?
