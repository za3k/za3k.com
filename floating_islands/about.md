- Cancelled sessions will be rare but in the Discord if they happen.

## Expectations
- Show up every week and be on time
- If you can't show up, let us know ahead of time. We'll play with 3+ players.
- Generally nothing is needed from players between sessions.
- Have a copy of the D&D rules (PDF is fine) and know the gist of the rules.

## Other stuff
