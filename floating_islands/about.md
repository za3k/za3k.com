# About
## When and where
- Play is by voice on Discord, and on roll20. 
- Sessions are every week, same time, every Tuesday. Game will be 2 or 3 hours.
    - 6pm-9pm PST
    - 9pm-12 midnight EST
- We'll try and do a 15-minute break
- Cancelled sessions will be rare but in the Discord if they happen.

## Expectations
- Show up every week and be on time
- Show up to the first session with a complete character. (Session zero is for making characters)
- If you can't show up, let us know ahead of time. We'll play with 3+ players if the group wants to.
- Generally nothing is needed from players between sessions.
- Have a copy of the D&D rules (PDF is fine) and know the gist of the rules.

## Other stuff
- All experience levels welcome, none to lots.
- Hopefully we'll be playing a while! Last campaign ran a year.
- Sessions may be recorded. The recordings will never be posted anywhere, the DM is just a packrat.
- Session recaps are posted on the discord.
- Session zero will be 2022-03-12.
