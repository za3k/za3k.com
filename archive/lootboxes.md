# Loot Boxes
Written 2021-02-08 by Zachary Vance

A short storytelling game for 2-4 players, better with fewer. Play as long as you want, 10-60 minutes.

- Each player describes their character in one or two sentences. They also have a starting inventory of any three items they want.
- One player starts out as GM. The GM describes a challenging situation. For example the player's driver's license has expired but they need to get to the airport to pick up Rhianna.
- The next player describes how they solve the challenge using an item in their inventory. For example, they use their Grouch Marx disguise to blend in with the orcish army.
- When a player beats the challenge, the GM rewards them with a loot item. Items are totally random, and shouldn't relate to the challenge.
- The player always loses the item they used to solve the challenge--all items are one-use only.
- After the player beats the challenge, they become the GM. They choose another player, and issues that player the next challenge.
- The game is over when it gets boring, or after a set number of challenges.
- **Variant**: You can have one GM the entire game who does every challenge and loot reward.
- **Variant**: When you succeed at a challenge, get two items, not one. Players start with only one item.
