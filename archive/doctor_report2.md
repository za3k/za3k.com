## Zachary Vance - Symptom Timeline

### Non-recent, heart-related
- **2019-06-04**: Retired (became more sedentary)
- **2020-01-23**: **"Skipped" or hollow-feeling beat** (first heart palpitation). At colorado airport (high-altitude), on some caffein.

- **2020-10-09**: First **heart racing**
- **2020-12-09**: Began new exercise program. Previously had started laying down 20-22 hours a day during quarantine. Instead started sitting all day, using standing desk at least an hour a day, eating more veggies, etc. Still going as of 2021-04.
- **2020-12-12**: Confirmed heart is racing for no reason (90-130bpm, for half hour to hour), feeling of it being 'exhausted' outside those periods. Some B-2 and riboflavin supplementation seemed to relieve "exhausted" feeling. Heart racing and tiredness symptoms disappeared a few weeks after this. I stayed on occasional B-2 but not riboflavin.

### Recent (complete)
The first time a symptom appears, it is **bolded**.

I've had two distinct kinds of lightheadedness--ask me about it. The first kind was the usual kind--like when you stand up too quickly. It usually got better or went away if I sat or laid down. The second I don't know how to describe, but it seemed to be hard to focus, and it was correlated with pressure in my head or feeling like blood was pooling in my head.

- **2021-03-24**: Had a short **episode** where I felt like I increasingly wasn't getting oxygen (but could physically breathe fine). Checked using a pulse oximiter--blood oxygen was 96%, but pulse was 120 and rose to 180 by the time I grabbed my roommate to keep an eye on me. Went back down within a couple minutes. Legs/arms were clenching on their own. Had a glass of water and an ibuprofen. Heart rate was relatively normal (85-90) an hour later so didn't go to the ER. Episode was about 2 hours after a stressful falling-out with a stranger. Trouble sleeping.
- **2021-03-25**: Try to relax. Feeling ok.
- **2021-03-26**: Center of **chest tender**.
- **2021-03-27**: Fine.
- **2021-03-28**: Fine. **Muscles twitching**. **Bottom of throat feels lightly choked**
- **2021-03-29**: Fine. Muscles twitching, esp chest. Choking feeling.
- **2021-03-30**: Muscles twitching. **Throat feeling 'pinched' and closed up**, choking. **Green poop**. **Possible heart racing episode.**
- **2021-03-31**: **Lightheaded**. Choking feeling absent.
- **2021-04-01**: Chocking feeling returning. Lightheaded when standing. At night, **mechanical trouble breathing**, especially face down or face up. In evening, **throat swollen, irritated feeling in chest**. Worried I was stopping breathing when falling asleep--body felt like it just wouldn't bother with the inhale. Moved to living room to sleep, had roommate watch me a bit. Sleep apnea also worse than usual.
    - Developed theory that the cause might be environmental (ex. allergy) and stayed in living room for several days to test.
- **2021-04-02**: Living room. Made Doctor's appt at Highland Hospital. Breathing fine in morning. Lightheaded in evening sitting down (worse standing). Throat closing up in evening. **Blood pooling in hands** in evening.
- **2021-04-03**: Living room. Throat slightly closed up. Chest, right side twitchy. Short of breath just sitting. Throat closing up in evening. Chest tight/sore. Just **right half of throat swollen**, **feeling of something stuck in throat**. While laying on floor nearly asleep, sudden huge **spasms on one side of chest (forget which)**--whole lower chest rapidly compacting and releasing. checked heart rate right after, 160bpm. I seemed fine, so went back to sleep about 5-10 minutes later.
- **2021-04-04**: Living room. **Cold sore.** Quick heart race, felt hard to breathe. **Heartbeat looked irregular** while standing (and checking pulse). Trembly, flushed, lightheaded sitting after. Throat swollen+lightheaded in evening.
- **2021-04-05**: Living room. Cold sore. Lightheaded.
    - Telemedicine visit
- **2021-04-06**: Living room. Cold sore. Internal hemmorhoid starting? Poss irregular heartbeat.
- **2021-04-07**: Slightly lightheaded. Out of breath from things like drinking water. Left leg 'pulsing a little'. **Feel heavy** / trembly. Feeling of something caught in throat. Slight **feeling of having inhaled water**, like down nose.
    - Swapped air filter in my room.
- **2021-04-08**: Feeling of something stuck in throat. Slightly out of it. Lightheaded. Dizzy. Poss vertigo+panic at night.
- **2021-04-09**: Cold sore gone. Internal hemmorhoid starting? Something stuck in throat. **Heart rate extremely low at night (50s, dipped below once)**. Monitoring heart rate. Felt/saw like heart stopped (unclear if true), then sudden fast heart rate (50 to 160). bpm ~59 after this.
- **2021-04-10**: Stressed. Short of breath. More weird-beat palpitations than usual.
- **2021-04-11**: Lightheaded when standing. Head feels weird and intense when standing, like **blood pooling in my head**. Feeling of **hearing shutting off** in one ear.
- **2021-04-12**: Head weird and floaty. Blood in left leg twitching. When nearing sleep, a **whomp of blood vessels tightning or releasing or something for 2-3 sec**? Trouble sleeping.
- **2021-04-13**: **Feeling of all the blood suddenly rushing from my head** while sitting there. Up until then, had felt some pressure/extra blood in head. Dizzy for a minute or two after, like room was swaying a bit. Heart went a little fast (95-120). Blood rushing to head slowly while falling asleep. Trouble sleeping.
- **2021-04-14**: Lightheaded. Blood suddenly rushed to/from head. **Face slightly numb**, sweat. Minor acid reflux. Heart went a little faster for a bit. Trouble standing even a few minutes. Trouble sleeping.
- **2021-04-15**: Feeling of blood pooling in face/head. Very lightheaded standing. Trouble standing even a few minutes. Did not sleep.
- **2021-04-16**: Hospital visit. Feeling much better, can walk around and stand. Became lightheaded around 3pm in hospital. Lightheaded and a little dizzy. Head feels heavy. Slept. Rapid shallow breathing, felt fine. Extra sleeping. Floaty/dreamy. Tilting my head past vertical feels weird. Acid reflux. Trembly arms. Palpitations, feel dizzy.
    Got lightheaded in the hospital with a mask on--some evidence this is not environmental.
- **2021-04-17**: Worrying about stroke because of headaches/blood pooling in head. Called 911 in the morning, thought I had a transient stroke--woke up or was almost asleep when I suddenly head a headache and couldn't move or call out. Was probably a false alarm--EMTs decided I did not need to go to the ER. Feeling heady, especially head, like gravity is turned up.
- **2021-04-18**: Pretty good. Heart races in morning (5-15 sec), felt a surge of adrenaline when waking up for 1st one. Lightheaded and dizzy. Head heavy.
- **2021-04-19**: Feeling good. Head heavy, dizzy.
- **2021-04-20**: Feeling good. Heart a little fast, somewhat stupid.
- **2021-04-21**: Feeling good. Heart a little fast, somewhat stupid.

Notes: I take my morning pulse and sometimes my standing pulse as a regular thing. Other measurements are sporadic, so they may ex. have been because I thought my heart was going fast (very biased). I frequently write a measurement as a range (highest and lowest stable number seen). If there are multiple measurements in a category, I've combined the ranges. A star indicates this measurement might be unusual for some reason.
Measurements are with a "ZacVrate" pulse oximeter

Measurements are with an "Intellisense" cuff that goes near your wrist. Generally I try to take them after sitting for at least 5 minutes, with my arm around heart level, as per the included instructions.
My measurements do NOT seem to match a doctor's office measurements.
