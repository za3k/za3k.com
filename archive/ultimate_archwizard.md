# Ultimate Archwizards
## Premise
You are an Ultimate Archwizard of your school--maybe you are the Laser Archwizard, maybe you're the Ultimate Genie who can grant any wish, or maybe you're the World Pro Wrestling champion who's so good you can compact opponents into a black hole while monologuing.

The Dark Lord has finally come to your solar system, and they will conquer it without fail as they have all others before yours, unless you stop them! Only you, the most powerful beings of your world, can possibly stop the Dark Lord.

## Character and world creation (part 1)
 - Draw or describe your character.
 - **Powers**: Decide what you're the Ultimate Archwizard of ("lasers", "wishes", or "pro wrestling"). The GM  will give you three special powers based on what you're the Ultimate Archwizard of.
 - **Seal**: You are so powerful, most of your powers must remain sealed--describe how. Are you wearing heavy  weights? Do you have a special magical eyepatch holding back your cool glowing eye? Are you lazy?
 - **Skills**: Pick three skills your character is good at.
 - **Dark Lord**: Describe one strength of the Dark Lord. No one knows their weaknesses, if any.

## Character creation (part 2)
 - You have 10 skill points. Divide them into skills however you want.

## Challenges
 - Whenever you encounter a challenge, it can be solved through roleplay, Ultimate Archwizard **Powers**, or through using your ordinary **skills**
 - **Powers** 100% always succeed, but they may not always have the effect you expect!
 - To use a **skill**, roll d6 and add your skill.
    - If the result is at least as high as the difficulty, you succeed.
    - If it's lower than the difficulty, you fail. Add 1 to your skill--you've improved through experience.
    - If you succeed or fail, describe how! 

## Progression
You are already the ultimate Archwizard. There is no up to go from here. But, you may be able
 to go sideways. If there's more than one session, you become the Archwizard of a second thing. Pick that
thing!

## Victory
You win when the Dark Lord is defeated--whether through battle, diplomacy, seduction, or elaborate time paradox.
