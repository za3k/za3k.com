# Ultimate Archwizards vs the Dark Lord
## Premise
You are an Ultimate Archwizard of your school--maybe you are the Laser Archwizard, maybe you're the Ultimate Genie who can grant any wish, or maybe you're the World Pro Wrestling champion who's so good you can compact opponents into a black hole while monologuing.

The Dark Lord has finally come to your solar system, and they will conquer it without fail as they have all others before yours, unless you stop them! Only you, the most powerful beings of your world, can possibly stop the Dark Lord.

**Ultimate Archwizards vs the Dark Lord** is designed to be played by 3-6 players (including one GM), in one 2-4 hour session, with no player or GM preparation.

## Character and world creation (part 1)
 - Draw or describe your character.
 - **Mastery** and **powers**: Decide what you're the Ultimate Archwizard of ("lasers", "wishes", or "pro wrestling" in the examples above). The GM will describe how you are the **master** of your school, and describe your three special **powers**.
 - **Seal**: You are so powerful, that your powers must remain sealed--describe how. Are you wearing heavy  training weights? Do you have a special magical eyepatch holding back your cool glowing eye? Are you lazy? As long as your **seal** is in place, you can't use your **powers**. The GM will let you know when it's safe to unseal your powers.
 - **Skills**: Pick three skills your character is good at.
 - **Dark Lord**: Describe one strength and/or special power of the Dark Lord. No one knows their weaknesses, if any.

## Skill List
 - The DM will collect the list of skills from all players into one list. Then they will add 3 more skills. These are now all the skills available in the game. All challenges will be solvable by one or more skills in the skill list. Any other skills (climbing?) are unheard of in your world, and you can't solve challenges that way.

## Character creation (part 2)
 - **Skills** You have 10 skill points. Divide them into any number of skills, however you want. You can pick from any skills in the skill list.
    - 0 points means you're unable to use that skill. With 0 points in pottery, you don't know how to make pots.
    - 2 points represents the pinnacle of normal human achievement. 2 point in pottery means your pots would be sold for millions of dollars as masterpieces.
    - You're an Ultimate Archwizard, so you can have an unlimited number of points assigned to a skill.

## Challenges
 - Whenever you encounter a challenge, it can be solved through **roleplay**, Ultimate Archwizard **Powers**, or through using your ordinary **skills**
 - **Powers** 100% always succeed. They may not always have the effect you expect.
 - To use a **skill**, roll d6 and add your skill.
    - If the result is at least as high as the difficulty, you succeed.
    - If it's lower than the difficulty, you fail. Add 1 to your skill--you've improved through experience.
    - If you succeed or fail, describe how! Feel free to describe the reaction of the NPCs and the world around you, not just your character.

## Progression
You are already the ultimate Archwizard. There is no up to go from here. But, you may be able
 to go sideways. If there's more than one session, you become the Archwizard of a second thing. Pick that
thing!

## Victory
You win when the Dark Lord is defeated--whether through battle, diplomacy, seduction, or elaborate time paradox.
