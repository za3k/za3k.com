[za3k](/) > treehouse forest

ETA: Fall 2021 / Early Summer 2022
Place: Central USA

All right, so I liked Burning Man and Ephemerisle and stuff. Let's do one of those.

My idea is: go out in the woods for a week. Build a bunch of cool ass treehouses with bridges and ladders and stuff between them. Live in them and have a good time. Music and lights and lembas wafers :P Construction during the day, chill and party at night. Make some absolutely bonkers shit.

I wanna make something with a pulley system, and lembas wafer and hot cocoa, and like a million wind chimes, and a giant windmill. And it's gonna have bridges to the rest of the village, with mechanical power transmission, and a wood saw powered by the windwill, and...

Stuff we need
- Lots of people (20-100?)
- Cool treehouse ideas
- Buy a piece of forest land to do this on. If no one has some to volunteer we can all chip in and buy some.
- Supplies (lots!!): lumber, wood screws, tarps, ropes, pulleys
- Tools: drills, hammers, saws, hauling systems, generator, chainsaws, sewing machines
- Stupid gadgets: LED lights, pinwheels, speakers
- Human stuff: Food, drinks, drugs, costumes
- Furniture: matresses, sleeping bags, bean bag chairs
- Safety plan (will not be safe): road access, car, first aid, way to get injured people out of a tree

Rules
- NO ASSHOLES (/ drama queens)
- NO FIRE (near the trees)
- MAKE SHIT. No one's just along for the party
- Kids discouraged (babies/toddlers at your own risk, but no 12-year-olds please)
- I dunno, probably a waiver or some shit?
