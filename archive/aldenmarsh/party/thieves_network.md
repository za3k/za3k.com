# Thieves Network

The Thieves' Network is an informal bunch of people in Canyonport who provide services for each other.

## Benefits

- Get a guy. Need a fence? A lock-picking expert? An invite to that high-end ball that will unlock its vault for a day?
- Info. Get all the latest rumors and gossip, or ask around for info. You can find out who someone is, get floor plans, or find out where to buy or sell anything.
- Stuff. The thieves' network is definitely more about connections and information than goods, but you can find some dubiously legal, or outright illegal goods on the local black markets.

## People

- Stumpy. Halfling with a peg leg, and an insatiable thirst for free beer (and friends who feel the same). Found hanging out at literally every bar, especially the Lazy Donkey in the foreign quarter. He doesn't know everything, but he knows all the latest and who to ask.
