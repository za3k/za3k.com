## About the Black Oracle

- The Black Oracle is a magical artifact, a huge stone set of lips. It is one of the Hundred Wonders.
- The oracle answers any factual question put to it which can be answered in a few words. It only ever answers one question per person, but it answers up to 14 questions per year. It has between 0 and 14 questions remaining this year.
- If a question cannot be answered in a few words, or if it is nonsense, the oracle says nothing. If two consecutive questions are not answered, that person is counted as having received an answer, and one of its 14 questions has been used up.
- It can answer questions in any language, but please ask all questions exactly as phrased, in the original language.
- Light interfere with the oracle--questions asked in light may not work, or may receive incorrect answers.
It answers all questions said aloud in the room. Avoid asking questions while on your mission for safety.
- After it has answered 14 questions, or if it is exposed to magical light, it teleports hundreds of miles.
