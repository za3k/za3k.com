# The Blinded Eye: Publicity Cell

## Goals

The Blinded Eye is a group trying to overthrow the theocracy of Aldenmarsh and put another government in its place.

## Organization

The Blinded Eye has an "outer circle" of clueless nobodies, from which an "inner circle" of what you estimate are 50 people have been pulled. The inner circle operates in cells of 4-10 people, who operate indepedently and don't know each others identities. Every week you get orders from "White", a member of another cell.

## Methods

Your cell is in charge of publicity and recruiting. You want to give the Blinded Eye publicity, and good publicity. 

Common orders include
- Spread (true or probably true) smack about the Church and what they do. 
- Find people to join the outer circle meetings. Run the meetings and lead weekly discussions, steering the discussion toward useful topics that make people question the Church.
- You sometimes nominate one of them as being trustworthy and effective to join a cell. For security reasons you don't hear from them afterwards.
- Put up Blinded Eye graffiti and spread word that it exists. Try to avoid stuff being traceable back to you.

## Codewords and Security

You have various secret signs and codewords, but they're mostly for fun, and you all know each others' real names in your cell. **Come up with street name / nickname and I'll add it below.**

## People
Cell members
- Heldir "Peacekeeper" Folgar - Recruiter
- "Big T" Tommy - Graffiti
- Storm "Storm" Tempest - Communication and Magic (Note: recruited by Robert)
- Penny "Jacks" Nolen - Rumors and gossip
- Arnold "Bonecrusher" Reedson - Recruiter, does meetings

Other cells
- White - gives you orders, maybe she's from the leader cell? She's annoyed that you all know who each other are.
