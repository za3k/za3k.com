Aldenmarsh uses silver currency in three coin sizes. The most common is the silver coin (the middle size), and all D&D prices on this site are given in sp (silver coins). The coins are minted by the Silver Hall, and used everywhere in the region, not just Aldenmarsh.

### Silver coin sizes

- One silver bit (0.1sp). 
    - "3 bits" or "3 silver bits" means 0.3 sp (or 3cp).
- One silver coin (1 sp) is the basic unit of currency. A silver coin is made of 10 silver bits.
    - "100 silver", "100 silver coins", and "100 coins" all mean 100 sp.
- One silver round (10sp) is sometimes used by rich people for for large purchases. A silver round is made of 10 silver coins, or 100 silver bits.
    - "10 rounds" or "10 silver rounds" means 100 sp
    - Most bars offer a (poor-quality) round of drinks for the house for a round.

### D&D Conversions

- One copper piece (cp) is 0.1sp
    - People don't know about copper coins
- One silver piece is the same as one silver coin (1sp).
- One gold piece (gp) is 10sp
    - If you say "100 gold" in Canyonport, they're used to foreign merchants so they'll probably understand. They might give you a lecture about "foreigners". Outside port towns you'll only get confused looks.
    - When converting standard D&D prices, just add or remove a zero. A price of 1,000 sp on this website is 100gp in normal D&D, and vice versa. I recommend writing down all your money in sp on your character sheet but it's up to you.
- One platinum piece (pp) is 100sp.

### Larger sums

- Large purchases are usually done with money or trade goods, not barter
- Silver bars are sometimes used for very large sums. They may have an amount stamped on them, given in silver coins (ex. A "1,000 coin" label stamped into a 10-pound bar).
- Letters of bank transfer are also used sometimes for large sums (for example, when buying a house). This is mostly done by merchants who don't want to actually ship valuable goods in case they're lost. Banks are not yet trusted by the citizens.
- Expensive trade goods could also be used. Spices, gold bars, potions, or gems are used for very large sums. None of these are treated as money, although people understand that gold is money in some foreign parts.
