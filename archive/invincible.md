# No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE! (v2)
Written: 2021-02-08 by Zachary Vance. Version [1](/archive/invincible1.md) 2.

**No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!** is a game for 2-8 players. Some of the players are Heroes, and some are Villains. It's designed to be shorter (60 minutes) and friendly for players new to storytelling games.

| Players | Heroes | Villains |
|---------|--------|----------|
| 2       | 1      | 1        |
| 3       | 2      | 1        |
| 4       | 2      | 2        |
| 5       | 3      | 2        |
| 6       | 3      | 3        |
| 7       | 4      | 3        |
| 8       | 5      | 3        |

Before the game, each Villain prepares a lair full of 6 obstacles. The game is about 15 minutes of prep for the Villains, and 45 minutes of play. During the game, Villains set the scene, and Heroes describe the action and outcome.

The Villain's goal is to send wave after wave of increasingly stronger enemies at the Heroes, letting them slowly grow in strength until they can defeat the Villain.

If your group is competitive, try to be the first Hero to kill a Villain, and the first Villain to be killed. Whether you like to cooperate, compete, or just have fun making up silly stories--avoid killing a Hero, or everyone loses.

You will need 6 index cards per villain, and 1 index card per hero (or similar materials, notebook paper will also work). You also need one d6 per player during character creation.

I AM INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)* - Peter Ansprach, 100 Things I'd Do If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord

## Making Heroes
Roll randomly to make your Hero. "I am a ..." (roll once per column)

| d6   | Class            | Approach  | Origin                          | Motive                | Hero Goal
|------|------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1    | Mexican Wrestler | Physical  | Texan wolves raised me to       | make friends          | by working at this temp agency      |
| 2    | Mad Scientist    | Smarts    | I traveled back in time to      | avenge my parents     | on the last floor of the dungeon    |
| 3    | Cute Witch       | Spirit    | After flunking college, I'll    | be, the -very- best   | by befriending every single monster |
| 4    | Stage Magician   | Charm     | I am the chosen one who will    | make the world better | by killing everything I see         |
| 5    | Living Robot     | Energy    | I sailed the seven seas to      | barely make a living  | by betraying the heroes             |
| 6    | Lone Gunslinger  | Coolness  | In Japanese high school, I will | defeat my rival       | by foiling the villain's plan       |

- Make up a name for your hero.
- Write down the six approaches: **Physical, Smarts, Spirit, Charm, Energy, Coolness**. Put a checkmark next to the approach you rolled. This is the only approach you can use right now.
- You can immediately describe your Hero to all the other Heroes and Villains.
- As you adventure, you will may get sweet **Loot**. Loot gives you additional approaches. When you get Loot, add a checkmark.
- Heroes start with 2 HP, or Health Points. If you are reduced to 0 HP, you die and the game is over for everyone. 
- If you beat a Villain on the last level of their lair, you and the Villain both win and stop playing. You can relax and watch the rest of the game.
- If the Heroes collectively beat all the Villains, the land is safe. All Heroes and Villains win, even if you didn't beat a Villain.

| 6    | Scratches the itch on my | pet         | or I'd have to assume my ultimate form            |

### Making Obstacles (for Villains)
1. Design 6 **Obstacles** for the Heroes to face as they go through your lair.
    - Each one is written on an index card.
    - The front looks like this: "Flock of Seagulls, 4 weaknesses. Loot: Physical". It should be legible.
    - The back looks like this: "Weaknesses: Physical, Smarts, Charm, Coolness". The back is never shown to the Heroes so you can be sloppy.
2. Pick each of the 6 obstacles.
    - Describe each Obstacle in 2-4 words, writing it legibly on the front of an index card. For example, write "Flock of Seagulls".
    - It could be a minion, a trap, a secret door, or anything else at all. Make your Obstacles interesting and goofy.
    - You, the Villain, are always the 6th and final Obstacle. Give yourself a card too.
3. Make a piece of loot the players get for overcoming the obstacle. Write the word "Loot" on the front of the card. Randomly roll an approach using the table below, and write it next to the word "Loot".
4. For each Obstacle, roll d6 using the table below to determine which approaches out of the 6 available approaches that Obstacle is weak to. Write the weaknesses on the back of the card. Do not show weaknesses to the Heroes. You may write the NUMBER of weaknesses on the front as a reminder to players.
    - The 1st obstacle is weak to all 6 approaches. (You don't need to roll.)
    - The 2nd obstacle is weak to 4 approaches. (Rolling and describing what the obstacle is NOT weak to may be faster)
    - The 3rd obstacle is weak to 3 approaches
    - The 4th obstacle is weak to 2 approaches.
    - The 5th obstacle is weak to 2 approaches.
    - The villain is weak to only 1 approach.
5. Stack your index cards neatly, so only the front of the first Obstacle is visible to Heroes.
6. Get ready to describe the first obstacle in your lair aloud.
    - Whenever an Obstacle is first revealed to the Heroes, you describe the Obstacle aloud to them. 
    - Make the Obstacle sound easy, cool, sexy, or rewarding. You want Heroes to come to your lair and kill you, instead of one of the other villains.
    - Try to hint at any weaknesses in your description. Heroes shouldn't be going in blind.
    - Describe the obstacle in a way that matches BOTH the written description, and the weaknesses you roll. For example, a Ogre weak to Physical might have a big target on their back. It's hard to match both but that's what makes it fun.

| d6 | Approach |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Physical |
| 2  | Smarts   |
| 3  | Spirit   |
| 4  | Charm    |
| 5  | Energy   |
| 6  | Coolness |

## How to Play
- Each Hero describes their character
- Each Villain describes their persona, weak point and goal, and their lair.
- Each Villain reveals their lair's first Obstacle. They give a description aloud of the Obstacle, which players enjoy and listen to carefully for clues. 
- Select which Hero goes first however you like.
- For the remainder of play, each Hero in turn selects a visible Obstacle. After they beat it or fail, play passes to the next Hero. This continues until the game is won or lost.
- Obstacles (Success and Failure)
    - Each Hero in turn selects one Obstacle, indicating it. The Hero states which of six approaches they use: **Magic**, **Spirit**, **Physical**, **Smarts** they use. For example "Gertie uses Spirit on the flock of seagulls." Heroes can only use the approaches marked on their character sheet.
    - The Villain gives a thumbs up if the Obstacle is weak against that approach, or a thumbs down if it is not. The Villain never describes the action after they set the scene.
    - If the Hero failed, another hero can choose to jump in and help. They should use a different approach. If the second hero fails, the attempt is over. If multiple heroes want to help, the failing Hero selects who helps.
- Obstacles (Failure)
    - If one Hero failed, they describe what they attempted and how it failed. If two Heroes fail, the first Hero to attempt describes how they failed, and the second Hero describes how they tried to help and how that also failed.
    - All Heroes who failed the Obstacle take 1 HP of damage.
- Obstacles (Success)
    - If one Hero attempted the Obstacle, they describe how they succeeded, and the loot they get.
    - If one Hero failed and a second Hero succeeds, the succeeding Hero humorously describes how the first Hero was failing, and how the second Hero did things right after they jumped in. The second Hero describes the loot they get.
    - No Heroes take damage.
    - The Hero describes where and how they got the Loot, and what it is. If there was a helping Hero, the helper is the one who gets the Loot. The Hero now has an additional approach, which they mark down on their character sheet.
    - After an Obstacle is beaten, that Villain turns face-up the next Obstacle in their lair, and describes it aloud to the Heroes just like the first.
- Final Villain Showdown
    - When turning face-up the final card, the Villain describes their inner sanctum, and how the villain greets the Hero. They describe the villain in more detail, hinting at any weaknesses.
    - The final fight works exactly like any normal Obstacle.
    - When the final Villain is defeated (or wins against a Hero), the Villain can help describe the action if they want. Villains are encouraged to cry out "No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!" or similar nonsense on defeat.
- Winning or Losing the Game
    - Victory: If a Hero beats a Villain, both the Hero and Villain win and watch the rest of the game without taking part.
    - Victory: If all Villains are beaten, everyone wins.
    - Defeat: If even one Hero dies (is reduced to 0 HP), all remaining Heroes and Villains lose.
