=Ninjas Ninjas Ninjas!

*Ninjas Ninjas Ninjas!* is a fast-paced storytelling game about how damn cool ninjas are, for 3 more or players (instructions are written for 3). New events and challenges happen rapidly, and which player is doing what shifts quickly.

Each of player controls a young journeyman ninja taking his/her/their final ninja exam. The three ninjas work together as a team to accomplish their goal. At all times one ninja is in **Front**. The "Front" ninja is the "player" who is actively deciding what to do, while the other ninjas throw problems and marks at them.

Storytelling focuses on being very cool and fast-paced. Extra description always illustrates just how damn COOL the ninja team and their moves are, not the scenery or the problems they encounter.

At the end of the exam, ninjas are graded on stealth, skill, and whether they accomplished all the mission goals. 

==Before starting
One player shouts "First!". A second player shoulds "Second!". The slowest player is Third.
- the first player decides the **Place**. Do ninjas have naruto powers or they realistic? Are there cell phones? Is your team good or bad? Where does the exam take place?
- the second player decides the **Team**. They come up with three ninjas. Everyone else picks a ninja--whoever grabs it first gets it. Then the second player gets the remaining ninja. Whoever grabbed the very first ninja is in **Front**. I recommend naming ninjas after colors (Green, Red, and Blue), and having each player be the same color game to game.
- the third player decides the main **Goal**. They decide the mission the three ninjas have to accomplish for their final exam.
- Each player grabs three **ninja stars**. You can keep track of how many ninja stars you have with coins, counting on your fingers, or in your head.
- The Front ninja is the team leader, so they assign the three **Roles**--Goal, Enemy, and Cheat.

==Front
One ninja is always in **Front**. The are the team leader and decide what the team does. 

- Whenever Front thinks another ninja should take charge, they just yell "Red, Front!" and now the Red ninja is in Front. They toss Red a **star**. It's coolest if Front puts another ninja in charge when the other ninja would be able to handle the situation or next step of the plan better.
- They describe what the team does, but they shouldn't explain why. Other players should make an effort to understand Front's plan so they can continue it. Ignoring the last Front's plan is lame.
- Front should describe both what the team does, and what's happening in the world. If there's a lull, another ninja can jump in and describe what's happening in the world.
- If the Front tells you to grab a bucket of water, you run to the well without hesitation--a passing ninja team will have to trust each other completely on a mission. When members of the team other than the Front do something, they should say "Yes, Front!" or very quickly without detail: "Green runs to the well and tosses Red a bucket". Keeping responses short keeps the attention on Front.
- Front can introduce new obstacles, but they're encouraged to introduce low-level peons and physical obstacles especially.

==Problems
- **Goal** throws Front a **star** to introduce a new goal, or shift an existing goal. A child might scream in a nearby room--the team needs to save (or gag) them. Or their assassination target might turn out to be an undercover agent, and the real villain is someone else. They yell "Goal" and quickly explain what happened and what the new goal is.
- **Enemy** introduces new enemies or events (someone spots you on the roof). Enemies are always people, never physical obstacles. Front or Cheat introduces physical obstacles. They yell "Enemy" and introduce the problem.
- **Cheat** throws Front a **star** to introduce a twist or surprise. They're consistent with the Place set up at the start, but it might not match the story so far. The car you stole to get away was rigged with remote explosives, or the boss you killed in Act One shows up again looking fine, with your infiltration plan in hand.

==Marks (Grading)
- If the team accomplishes a goal, does something quickly, **Goal** throws Front a star. 
- If the team does something cool, or Front introduces an obstacle, **Enemy** throws Front a star.
- If the team does something skillfully or in a clever way, **Cheat** throws Front a star.
- Front doesn't grade the team--only the other two ninjas throw grading stars.
- If **Goal** decides the team accomplishes the main goal, they shout "**PASS!**". The ninjas have passed the final and won the game. The game is over.
- If a ninja runs out of stars, they shout "Ninja Down". They are now Front. The old Front immediately swaps Roles with them, permanently. For example, if Front (Red) was Cheat, and Enemy (Blue) runs out of stars, then Blue becomes both Front and Cheat, and Red takes over as Enemy. Both other ninjas throw the new Front a star so they're no longer out.

==Grading
- At the end of the game, your score is the number of stars you threw. My recommended method is to make a tally mark whenever you throw a star. This is your individual grade. The team score is the sum of the individual scores. If you don't have paper, or don't want to keep track, you can just guess instead.
- (Optional) The ninjas **fail the final** if 30 minutes pass and they haven't won. They also lose one point for each minute that passed before they complete their mission.

==More Players
- Ninjas Ninjas Ninjas requires at least 3 players, but it probably works with more. Come up with your own Problems and Grading for each new player. If you have good ideas and try them out, send it to me!
- Example: **Silence** in now in charge of Events, not **Enemy**. They can also introduce traps. They throw grading stars if the team does things stealthily, or without causing collateral damage.
