##Bentways, The:

The Bentways are a series of channels running throughout the underground of the [Orianian Wasteland](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Orianian%20Wasteland,%20The) in the Eastern continent of [Mizar-5](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Mizar-5). These tunnels stretch on for hundreds of kilometers, their framework based around the ancient [Aldebaranian](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Aldebaranians,%20The) ruins that originally housed the main body of the civilization. The tunnels themselves have grown over time due to their hybrid [Floramateria](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Floramateria) composition, believed to have originated from a meteor that was a product of the destruction of a planetoid on the edge of the [Archipelago of the Damned](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Archipelago%20of%20the%20Damned).

It is widely thought to be the cause of the end of the golden age of the Aldebaranian civilization, as its Floramateria spread rapidly, wiping out swaths of crops alongside infecting much of the populous, as dissection of subjects found in [Atemporal Anomaly](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Atemporal%20Anomaly) AA-153 has shown signs of Floramateria infiltration in the nervous channels.

The tunnels themselves are one of the largest contiguous danger zones on Mizar-5, and thus are one of the least studied, despite the extremely valuable knowledge enclosed within.
