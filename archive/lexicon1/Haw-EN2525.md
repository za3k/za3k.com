Haw-EN2525 (Stellar Object)

Haw-EN2525 is a quinary star system that is 3.2 light years away from the Mizar system. It holds no habitable planets, two gas giants and an thick asteroid belt directly within the goldilock zone of its circling star cluster, which might once have been a planet. Due to its intense light output and relatively close proximity, its presence shows in many [Derivative Starchart](Derivative Starchart)s on [Mizar-5](Mizar-5), where it is named the Bright Wanderer due to the planets rotational axis. 

While there is no direct proof of any culture on the planet tying this (from their perspective) unparallelled bright stellar object in the night sky, during the time of the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire) there are at least 17 different plays, musicals and movies either depicting a personified Bright Wanderer or bearing its astronomical symbol as a Leitmotiv, as shown in the [Manuscript Collection 47b](Manuscript Collection 47b) found and left in sito at [Traitor's Ridge](Traitor's Ridge)
