Loping Doge (Naval Vessel)

The sailing ship "The Loping Doge" was constructed as a personal parade-ship for [Omarius Dahl IV](Omarius Dahl IV) Elector-Prince of Ionzh, deliberately using the already antiquated propulsion through wind instead through sulphur-powered turbines. Measuring an incredible 386m in length, built 8 stories tall, and built out of rare woods from the [Denmortia Rainlands](Denmortia Rainlands), its 12 year construction nearly bankrupted the Principality of Ionzh, torpedoing his popularity while bribing the electees through loans from neighbouring regions. The Loping Doge never left the harbour, as the Elector-Prinz refused to pay the dockworkers their overdue paycheck, leading to a local revolt and the beheading of the Prinz. 3 months later, [Elector-Prince Rzeszutko](Elector-Prince Rzeszutko) was elected into office who turned the unfinished jewel of a ship into a public market hall and trade depot until it burnt down in an accident two centuries later. Remains of its hull, galleys figure and several documents and photographs could be found in an excavated time capsule near [Traitor' Ridge](Traitor' Ridge) and are now on holographic display.
