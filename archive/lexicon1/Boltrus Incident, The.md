The Boltrus Incident refers to a sequence of events that occurred somewhere between ESDTF February 12 - March 22, 3361 in a small village on [Mizar-5](Mizar-5). The incident is believed to be the first written mention of the practice of [Rotorastianism](Rotorastianism). The collection of diaries, journals, and accounts all describe an otherwise unremarkable woodcutter of the village having supposedly been struck by a floating grey apparition, in the shape of a [Long-Necked Gh'dol](Long-Necked Gh'dol), a species native to the planet. The woodcutter, upon awakening, began to etch her collected logs with strange symbols, their meanings known only to their maker. Sometime before or after this event, the village was attacked by unusually aggressive gh'dols, and the accounts of most other villagers stopped - most believe due to death or disappearance. The woodcutter who would later be known as [Zan-Taranth](Zan-Taranth) began a pilgrimage from Mizar-5 to spread her works to other peoples in the galaxy, and several surviving denizens of the village followed. With so few remaining members, the village itself soon fell into disarray, and the account of the last known surviving villager, recorded sometime between May 8 and 29 of the same year, alluded to the presence of some hostile spirit draining the village of its life and livelihood, with a lament for the future of surrounding towns.

The exact order of events is under constant debate and scrutiny from several historians, and will likely never be settled due to the moderate [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly) surrounding the village, but the most trustworthy and credible scholars indicate that this so-called apparition was simply an aging gh'dol, the aggression of gh'dols a frenzy spurred by its inevitable death, the deaths and disappearances caused by the ensuing frenzy, and the writings of the woodcutter, indecipherable nonsense from which sprang a ludicrous following of half-cracked zealots and pretenders. Wiser readers would do well to put to rest any notions of spiritualism or otherworldly presence the more incredulous elements of this incident might invoke.
