Iceproofed Shielding

Iceproofed Shielding, both in architecture and machinery, can be found in almost all settlements of the [[Golgori Sovereign Empire]] and concurrent cultures. It includes a duality of treated steel and hardened microfoam for isolation and then often painted in anti-stick ventablack to absorb as much sun energies as possible (however this extra layer of coating can usually be found only in later models). The further towards the north pole of [[Mizar-5]] the town is located, the older the shields are, showing the slow but steady spread of sub-zero temperatures after the Great Chill (see [[Great Chill, the]]). 

Noteworthy is the complete lack of any Iceproof Shielding within temples or dogmatic (and abandoned) settlements belonging to the [[Rotorastrianism]] religion, probably finding the act of blocking natural outside influences as heretical.
