The Nevermind-Debate Schism is a clockwise-future [B-time](B-time) academic social split resulting from the Nevermind-Debate. Because the Nevermind-Debate has not yet occured in A-Time, we can only guess at the contents of the debate by observing the resulting schism. (For the A-Time disagreement over the likely contents, see Nevermind-Debate Schism Schism). The facts as we know them are:

1. The debate seems to be an actual debate, broadcast by hologram on [Mizar-4](Mizar-4). The debate has been announced decades in advance as the Nevermind-Debate.
2. Observing the exact contents of the debates in A-Time creates a time paradox until at least 40 years in the future.
3. The B-time schism starts immediately after the debate, within hours
4. The schism proceeds for decades afterwards. The fallout seems to be mostly between scientists who presently study interstellar travel, especially pre-FTL travel.
5. Four species on one side of the schism have [Sanity Certification](Sanity Certification). All have it revoked during reconcilliation.

From this, we can deduce that the participants in the debate, or the topic of the debate, may involve spac
e travel. Given that the debate was announced decades in advance, it is unlikely to have been merely cance
lled.

Specific further deductions are pointless, because any sufficiently accurate guess would result in an imme
diate time paradox. Nonetheless, [Stasis Tourism](Stasis Tourism) to attempt to talk to a "Never-Mind" outside time itse
lf has spates of popularity.

However, the possibility of trying to deduce the *least* accurate guess has in this author's opinion been
insufficiently explored, owing to...
