Ormommon Forces are said to be mystic energies that emanate from objects charged with latent residual psychic power. Closely related to [[Psychic Attunement]], self-proclaimed psychics express interest in locating and attuning with these forces to enhance their connection to people, places, and events associated with the source. Accounts indicate that although these forces may exist anywhere, they're much more likely to be tied to places and objects associated with or belonging to previous psychics. 

Often, there *are* other effects, though the causal relationship between these effects and the Ormommon Forces is dubious - One such proclaimed object, the [[Nemarii Obelisk]], is of great interest to the psychic community, due to its tendency to disrupt contemporary communications devices, though this has already been attributed to an [[Extratemporal Anomaly]] located within. Another object of interest is a belt buckle belonging to [[Varix Jhothar]], one of the few personal effects recovered from the wreckage of his ship on [[Gondar-2]]. Psychics claim to be able to communicate with the long-dead captain simply by touching it, though they all have differing accounts describing what happened on the planetoid.
 
(Ed. Note - 'Mystic energies?' What rubbish. I'm going to throw the book at Collins for putting me on the Metaphysics Analysis and Cataloging Subcommittee when this is all over.)
