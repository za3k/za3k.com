*An Ionzhi Gazetteer* was a series of traveler’s handbooks published from Ionzhi years 5157 to 5245 (Real Ordinal Date Standard 454f9a - 45580e), produced by Werlact Julane until their execution in 5244 (RODS 45580b) by [Elector-Prince Rzeszutko](Elector-Prince Rzeszutko). The posthumous final edition of the book was sourced from Julane’s notes and published by their apprentices, before they were executed themselves. The travel guides covered the geography, history, culture, holidays, festivals, events, tourist attractions, inns, taverns, restaurants, and dangers of the entirety of the [Principality of Ionzh](Principality of Ionzh). The eleven regional editions were updated yearly, and covered every meter of populated land within their domains, and often detailed areas otherwise, such as camping sites, fishing spots, and caves. Most of the information sourced for these books came from Julane’s apprentices stationed throughout the Principality, and other paid informants. The Omnibus edition combined all the recent changes and was released every six Ionzhi years, and often were the size of a small boulder. 

Julane’s very detailed series of works has been highly informative, and a boon to those attempting to research the history of the late Principality, especially in the face of Elector-Prince Rzeszutko’s anti-historiographical efforts.
