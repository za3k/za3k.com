The H'dell Coffin, popularly known as the Half-Hearted Sarcophagus, is an Extratemporal Anomaly (see [Extratemporal Anomalies]]) discovered on Mizar-5. The Coffin is a bronze burial device dating from the early [Web-Weaver](Extratemporal Anomalies](Web-Weaver](Extratemporal Anomalies)) discovered on Mizar-5. The Coffin is a bronze burial device dating from the early [[Web-Weaver) period, depicting the internal organs and bone structure of a web weaver. It was flagged as worthy of further study by biologists, who had not yet found intact living Web-Weaver specimens.

On investigation, some organs appeared missing, but scientists disagreed over which ones. Comparing notes,
 it became clear that some carved organs were present in A-Time, others in [B-Time](B-Time). The Coffin does not
 change properties when moved.

Construction of a multi-timeline object would have been as far beyond bronze-age Web-Weaver technology as it is beyond our own today. Speculation that the Coffin was deliberately carved to only be visible to some kind of living Extratemporal Anomaly is unfounded, and it is more likely the result of a random [Universe-Universe Binary Interaction](Universe-Universe Binary Interaction).
