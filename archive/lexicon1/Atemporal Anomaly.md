# Atemporal Anomaly:


Many of the artifacts recovered from Mizar-5 are entirely unique in the universe. This cannot, of course, be credited to the unique thoughts of the Golgori civilization, but is due to the remarkable preservation that has occurred due to a series of anomalies that dot the planet's surface. Vastly extending the minimum quanta of time for all objects within, the Atemporal Anomaly mimics as if no time were to pass at all for the objects within, giving Mizar-5 its nickname of "The Frozen Planet". Xenoarcheologists exploring Mizar-5 must be highly cautious and always wear their [Type-9 Quantum Compression Apparatus (QCA-9)](Quantum Compression Apparatus (QCA)) to avoid getting trapped within the various anomalies, as there is often, especially within Class-Z danger areas, an abundance of these anomalies, which can be difficult to discern by the naked eye.

Some areas of the planet, such as the [Denmortia Rainlands](Denmortia Rainlands) are entirely covered by a Complete Atemporal Anomaly(which functionally stops the effects of time's passage within itself) while others are only affected by a Partial Atemporal Anomaly. Each is a veritable treasure trove, as many organic relics that would have otherwise decayed away millennia before discovery have been recovered. This, of course, includes the still functioning bodies of Mizar-5's inhabitants, however the process of having one's quanta of time stretched so violently results in brain death for any sentient life that undergoes the process, meaning that no interviews with the subjects have been possible.
