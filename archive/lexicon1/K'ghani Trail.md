The K'ghani Trail was used for two hundred standard years to wrangle now-extinct Fat Dogs (see [Eloping Dog](Eloping Dog), a surviving cousin). Dogs were walked from the [Principality of Ionzh](Principality of Ionzh), north and west to the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire). After the [Law of Finders Keepers](Law of Finders Keepers) stopped trade in animals, the trail was paved and became a major roadway. It was disused and gradually disintegrated with the adoption of the airbus, after Golgori Empire settlement.

The K'ghani Trail starts in western Ionzh near [Traitor's Ridge](Traitor's Ridge), winding through several small- and medium-sized cities. It then heads north through [Lithis Falls Pass](Lithis Falls Pass) and the scenic Pemnone Mountains. It briefly passes north and west through the Orianian Wasteland (see [Orianian Wasteland, The](Orianian Wasteland, The)), before terminating in the Golgori Sovereign Empire territory of Bondovi.
