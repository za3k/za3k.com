Balefyre Engine

High-scale combustion engine which acted as the main source of power in the late stages Golgari civilisation. These massive, power-producing furnaces were powered mainly with sulphuric coal but were capable of turning every carbon or sulphur-based material into fuel and were even used for cremation of the dead, as studies within the [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly) AA-47 clearly show. The construction of first Balefyre Engine can be traced back to the worsening climates of the northern hemisphere of Mizar 5, historically named "The Great Chill" ( see [Great Chill, the](Great Chill, the)) neary two decades before the final collapse of the Golgari. Recovered newsarticles withing the ruined city of [Heimhallif](Heimhallif) written during that time are split if these creations are a blessing or a curse due to their high levels of local air pollution, but their base design will be continued for at least a century.
