Mizar-4 is a designation given to a temperate planet in the Mizar system, located along the [Candaxx Loop](Candaxx Loop) trade route. It was previously inhabited by farmers and homesteaders mainly due to the generous solar cycle and nitrogen-rich soil promoting rapid growth of vegetation, and accounts for roughly 7% of the organic produce for the Mizar system and surrounding microsystems. As with other planets, Mizar-4 is host to dangerous [Floramateria](Floramateria), although recent breakthroughs in biodiversity preservation have minimized its impact on day-to-day life. 

Though not as active a historic site as [Mizar-5](Mizar-5), the planet is host to its fair share of historic discoveries, notably regarding various sects of [Rotorastrianism](Rotorastrianism) involved with [Zan-Taranth](Zan-Taranth) and the [Theory of Forgotten Sin](Theory of Forgotten Sin), this theory having gained footholds from adoption by locals in times of famine and strife. Based on local writings dated back to around the century ESDTF 4400-4500, it seems as though before the destruction of the [Institute for Psykologikal Masterie](Institute for Psykologikal Masterie), some scholars managed to establish a small satellite school on Mizar-4, and this small group is largely accredited with the continuation of instruction regarding [Psychic Attunement](Psychic Attunement).
