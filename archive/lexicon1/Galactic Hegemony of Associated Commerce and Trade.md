The Galactic Hegemony of Associated Commerce and Trade (or GHACT) is a interstellar megacooperation holding a great number of pre-FTL species under their political and economic dominion. Starting out as a galactic shipping company, their rise to power began with their monopoly on commercial interstellar travel in the [Vultraum Sector](Vultraum Sector). While this monopoly has since then losened, they still hold majority shares in their vassal states governments and full control over their off-planet in- and exports. 
Remains of GHACT packaging have been found on [Mizar-5](Mizar-5), their spokesperson refused clarification if their company used this off-limit planet for commerce or merely as waste dump, but the visual similarities between outdated GHACT automated shipping vessels and the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire)'s [Cataphract](Cataphract) project suggest that the technological and cultural development of the planet has been influenced from outside sources, be it intentional or not.

Investigation on a potential responsability of the company to the native populations extinction is still ongoing.
