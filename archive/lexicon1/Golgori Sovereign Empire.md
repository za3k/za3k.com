##Golgori Sovereign Empire

The Golgori Sovereign Empire was the largest, and most recent, civilization present on [Mizar-5](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Mizar-5), which came about approximately 1400 cycles after the fracturing of the [Principality of Ionzh](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Principality%20of%20Ionzh). The Empire's reach stretched over most of the habitable land on Mizar-5, and even began to stretch into the less habitable southern regions and the [Denmortia Rainlands](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Denmortia%20Rainlands). They are noteworthy for, based on the preserved [Cataphract](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Cataphract) found in the Rainlands, being the first of Mizar-5's civilization to develop vessels capable of interplanetary travel, though there is no evidence that any ever escaped Mizar-5's upper atmosphere. 

The Golgori started off as a group of traders, originally, and by utilizing the [Golgori Standard Cube](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Golgori%20Standard%20Cube) as their main form of currency, quickly became the dominant economic force in the [New Hinterland Peninsula](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/New%20Hinterland%20Peninsula), their place of origin. Cities sprung up around their trading posts, centered around the future Golgori capital, [Oedeon](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Oedeon). Though this empire enjoyed a long term of relative peace, as its creation was economic instead of a conquest, the [Rotorastrians](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Rotorastrianism) and the [New Golgori Rebellion](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/New%20Golgori%20Rebellion) both grew in the shadows of the empire, their threat peaking after the [Descent of the New Moon](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Descent%20of%20the%20New%20Moon,%20The), the aftermath of which lead to the [Manifold Battle](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Manifold%20Battle,%20The), which is widely believed to be the cause of the massive [Atemporal Anomaly](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Atemporal%20Anomaly) over the Denmortia Rainlands, and the [Great Chill](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Great%20Chill,%20the), which drove many of the Golgori south.

Remnants of the Golgori Sovereign Empire remain for another 300 cycles, after which it is surmised that they were finished off by [Sulfur Bankruptcy](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Sulfur%20Bankruptcy).
