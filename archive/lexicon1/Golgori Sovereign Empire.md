##Golgori Sovereign Empire

The Golgori Sovereign Empire was the largest, and most recent, civilization present on [Mizar-5](Mizar-5), which came about approximately 1400 cycles after the fracturing of the [Principality of Ionzh](Principality of Ionzh). The Empire's reach stretched over most of the habitable land on Mizar-5, and even began to stretch into the less habitable southern regions and the [Denmortia Rainlands](Denmortia Rainlands). They are noteworthy for, based on the preserved [Cataphract](Cataphract) found in the Rainlands, being the first of Mizar-5's civilization to develop vessels capable of interplanetary travel, though there is no evidence that any ever escaped Mizar-5's upper atmosphere. 

The Golgori started off as a group of traders, originally, and by utilizing the [Golgori Standard Cube](Golgori Standard Cube) as their main form of currency, quickly became the dominant economic force in the [New Hinterland Peninsula](New Hinterland Peninsula), their place of origin. Cities sprung up around their trading posts, centered around the future Golgori capital, [Oedeon](Oedeon). Though this empire enjoyed a long term of relative peace, as its creation was economic instead of a conquest, the [Rotorastrians](Rotorastrianism) and the [New Golgori Rebellion](New Golgori Rebellion) both grew in the shadows of the empire, their threat peaking after the [Descent of the New Moon](Descent of the New Moon, The), the aftermath of which lead to the [Manifold Battle](Manifold Battle, The), which is widely believed to be the cause of the massive [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly) over the Denmortia Rainlands, and the [Great Chill](Great Chill, the), which drove many of the Golgori south.

Remnants of the Golgori Sovereign Empire remain for another 300 cycles, after which it is surmised that they were finished off by [Sulfur Bankruptcy](Sulfur Bankruptcy).
