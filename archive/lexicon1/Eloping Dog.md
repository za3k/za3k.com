*Not be confused with the ship [The Loping Doge](Loping Doge, The).*

An Eloping Dog is a species of canine-analogous vertebrates, native to [Mizar-5](Mizar-5). They were originally tamed by [Aldebaranians](Aldebaranians, The) as hunting companions, but most of the population died to the [Floramateria](Floramateria) with their masters. A small number survived, and were kept as novelty pets for rich members of society, and their population rose. In Ionzhi year 5333 (RODS 456333) during [Elector-Prince Rzeszutko](Elector-Prince Rzeszutko)’s reign, a mass slaughter of the Eloping Dogs was carried out, allegedly because one vomited on the Elector-Prince. A small number were hidden by Research Station 6, and shipped offworld. Today, their number has risen to pre-massacre numbers, largely due to the efforts of the Mizar-4 Kennel Association.

The animal is named as such because of its peculiar behavior. At least once a fortnight (Mizar-5 time), the Eloping Dogs escape by unknown means during the night (local time). Each Dog in a roughly 50 kilometer area meets up in a location roughly in between all of them, where they sit together for the night, before they return to their original location by morning. This has shown to happen between Dogs that have no idea of each other’s existence. It is unknown by what means their transportation occurs, but a clue may be found in temporal sciences, as a Dog will lie down and become unresponsive if brought into an [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly). They will stay in this position until they are brought outside or die.
