Mizar-5 (Planet)

Mizar-5 is a now uninhabited, frozen planet of the size category 19, orbiting the yellow dwarf star of Mizar within the outer edge of the habitable zone. Its orbit is not entirely stable as the planetary body edges a few centimeters futher away from the sun every year, potentially caused by a large impact on the planetary surface (see [Descent of the New Moon, the]]). Geological features, ice-core samples and historical documents show that Mizar-5 once was of temperate climate until a documented weathershift (see [Great Chill, the]], before its complete freezing process it had several developed indigenous cultures inhabiting the surface, the latest of them, the Golgori (see [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Descent of the New Moon, the]]).

Mizar-5 is known in the academia for its high percentage of cross-reality and time-warping phenomenas, (see [Atemporal Anomaliy]], [Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [B-Time]]), as well as the [Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies](B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy](Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies](B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies](B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy](Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies](B-Time]]), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy]], [[Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time](Extratemporal Anomalies]], and [[B-Time)), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism](Atemporal Anomaliy), [[Extratemporal Anomalies), and [[B-Time)), as well as the [[Nevermind-Debate Schism) following its discovery, splitting the different interstellar Pre-FTL study fields for decades to come.
