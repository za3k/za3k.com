Curator's Bane

Archived Object #335, also called Curators Bane, is a weathered and slightly stained issue of [An Ionzhi Gazetter](An Ionzhi Gazetter) printed in 5197 of the [Ionzhi Calender](Ionzhi Calender). While appearing to be a standard piece of informative literature at discovery, it has proven to be a pain to draw reliable information from its contents or even keep it correctly filed away, due to it's apparently innate ability to shift between realtime, [B-Time](B-Time), as well as other potentially fictional timestreams and realities. These changes are irregular and change the content, Author and even language used within the object, while date and issue number appear to remain the same (or at least approximately, when the measurements of time or numerations work differently in the handbook's current reality. 
The resulting impossability to correcty order and file this object in relation to other findings and reports have given the artifact the title 'Curator's Bane'

Its most facinating realities in which it returns show a version of Mizar-5 that is a lush tropical jungleword inhabited by a doomsday-cult worshipping, warped version of the Golgari civilisation as we know it. This cult preaches the coming of a higher being called 'The Smotherer of Light' (--> [Smotherer of Light, the](Smotherer of Light, the)) that will devour the sun's radiance unless kept at bay through worship and ritualistic sacrifice.
