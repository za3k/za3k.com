Nemarii Obelisk

The Nemarii Obelisk is a 37ft tall basalt monolith on [Mizar-4](Mizar-4) displaying a variety of [Derivative Starchart](Derivative Starchart)s on its front and backside. Its construction date is unclear since all dating methods produce nothing but scrambled data when done with or near material from the obelisk, although it clearly predates the founding of the Golgori Sovereign Empire by at least one millenia, potentially being created or inspired by the spacefaring Kilt'iir civilisation (see[Kilt'iir, The](Kilt'iir, The)). The artifact, which remains in-situ due to its massive weight, bears no coherent written language, but the smaller rimsides show an intricate motive of abstract figures, geometric shapes and looping coils that are still up to debate. 

Besides the difficulties in dating, the presence of the obelisk also tends to mess with radio, micro and soundwaves, altering their frequency and producing results that on their own might look reasonable or coherent, but have nothing to do with reality when taken into context. Due to its strange properties, many pseudo-scientists claim that the artifact posesses mystical [Ormommon Forces](Ormommon Forces) tied to [Psychic Attunement](Psychic Attunement), however the much more realistic answer would be that the Nemarii Obelisk contains a stable miniature [Extratemporal Anomaly](Extratemporal Anomaly) inside itself, passively sending out data from another reality.
