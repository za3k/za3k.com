##Derivative Starchart:

Derivative starcharts are a series of relics discovered on both [Mizar-5](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Mizar-5) and [Mizar-4](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Mizar-4). They have a distinct pattern which aligns with many of the nearby stellar regions, accurate to relative distance and size. The areas within which they have been found include, the preserved [cataphract](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Cataphract) in the [Denmortia Rainlands](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Denmortia%20Rainlands), as well as several other large vessels that have been wrecked in various areas of the [Orianian Wasteland](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Orianian%20Wasteland,%20The), they have also been found in several [Aldebaranian](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Aldebaranians,%20The) ruins, as well as on the [Nemarii Obelisk](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Nemarii%20Obelisk) on Mizar-4. These relics are incredibly detailed, especially those found in the remains of the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Golgori%20Sovereign%20Empire), as those map all the way out until the beginning of the [Archipelago of the Damned](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Archipelago%20of%20the%20Damned).

Though these relics seem to have been first developed by the Aldebaranians, the advancement of their use over time, the relatively primitive method by which those found in later cataphracts were created, and several Aldebaranian texts discovered in [Atemporal Anomaly](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Atemporal%20Anomaly) AA-6674 in fact point that the starcharts we have been able to find are merely a derivative of a much more advanced work, one we have yet to discover. It is widely believed that the [Kilt'iir](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Kilt'iir,%20The), a now extinct race whose territory formerly included the Mizar system, was responsible for this uplifting, however, as their records on this matter have been lost it is difficult to confirm.
