The Law of Finders Keepers, preceding the [[Fengu-Golgari Convention of 2452]], is an extralegal term for the plundering of artifacts that occurred previous to 2452. The existence of this period is both a blessing and a curse for the historians cataloguing Golgori history - on the one hand, most highly trafficked sites, including those along the [[Candaxx Loop]] and in the [[Vultraum Sector]] had been picked clean of artifacts long before the preservation effort began. However, the valuation of texts, tools, and jewelry within imperialist groups of the period has helped keep many of these artifacts in better condition than if they were to have been left behind for the ravages of events like the [[Second Destruction of the Golgari Library]]. A particular gratitude goes to the descendants of the [[ve Kenton Family]] for their generous donations in the pursuit of historical preservation.
