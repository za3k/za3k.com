The Kilt'iir were a highly advanced civilization that occupied the Mizar system roughly between ESTDF years 200-1800. A number of notable historic discoveries are credited to the Kilt'iir, including highly detailed starcharts (See [[Derivative Starchart]],) and the [[Hess Drive]], perhaps the single most shrouded invention in Golgorian history, yet so important to our understanding of how the Golgori were able to achieve space travel without access to F- or G-level technology (See [[Industrial Ascendancy]].)

Due to the repeated destruction of information predating the Golgori (See [[Second Destruction of the Golgari Library]],) little information can be found on their interaction with the Kilt'iir before their mysterious disappearance before the turn of the second millennium. Some historians speculate that [[Elector-Prince Rzeszutko]] took pains to remove all traces of their existence in an attempt to avert his prophesized apocalypse, though the more credible explanation is that the monarchy simply wanted to maintain an iron grip on their rule, and the evidence of a more technologically advanced civilization before the Golgori could undermine that claim. 

Though it need not be mentioned to experienced historians, only those with Class-D [[Sanity Certification]] are allowed to analyze Kilt'iir artifacts. If any uninformed readers find what they suspect to be a Kilt'iir artifact, they are to report it to the IGARB immediately and avoid further contact with sentient beings until psychoactive stability can be verified.
