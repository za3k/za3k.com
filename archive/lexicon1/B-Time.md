B-Time is a continuous semi-parallel timestream, adjacent to our timestream. It contains the same celestial bodies and phenomena as our timestream does, including the [Atemporal Anomalies](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Atemporal%20Anomaly) on [[Mizar-5]]. However, there are a few notable differences: the [[Denmortia Rainlands]] do not exist, replaced by an empty desert, and neither does the famously quinary star system [[Haw-EN2525]], instead replaced by a singular red dwarf. Most important is the lack of any post-prokaryotic life, except for the [[Regina Apiana]], whose civilization is centered around the first [Aldebaranian](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Aldebaranians,%20The) settlements. Observation and travel to B-Time is unrecommended, for the cytotoxins produced by Regina Apiana can kill most life forms within a few microcycles.

Note: G-Time and D-Time are non-continuous semi-parallel timestreams, and anyone who claims they are continuous are misinformed or lying.
