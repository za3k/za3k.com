The New Hinterland Peninsula is a temperate region between 10.5 and 14.5 degrees north and 30 and 37.5 degrees west on [[Mizar-5]], east of the [[Denmortia Rainlands]]. Said to be the original homeland of the Golgori, and the [[Golgori Sovereign Empire]], the ruins of [[Oedeon]] are located near the eastern tip, having been a natural hub for trade and exploration given its proximity to the [[Y'lin River Basin]].

The area is rich in deposits of most minerals required to manufacture [[Phylidium]], and the air currents make the climate highly suitable for farming and homesteading, although notably, a lack of extraction sites indicates that only a modest amount of sulfur occurred naturally in the area, likely leading to the [[Sulfur Bankruptcy]] that caused the rapid contraction of the Golgori economy, beginning a period of strife and conflict, and eventually leading to the end of the Golgori empire.
