##Extratemporal Anomalies:

Extratemporal anomalies are a phenomenon that is, unlike what many believe, a very real occurrence in our universe. Though they do not take the form of such outlandish things as the famous system legend of the [Blinking Cow](Blinking Cow Rumor), there have been scientifically documented reports of [Universe-Universe Binary Interactions](Universe-Universe Binary Interaction) leading to phenomena that can result in objects entering or leaving the timestream unnaturally. There have been several examples of these anomalies throughout the star system, however, the one that is most relevant to this text is the [Lillux Colossus](Lillux Colossus), a silicon based lifeform seemingly unaffected by the alterations of timeflow within [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly) AA-5542 (in the underground [Denmortia Rainlands](Denmortia Rainlands). Energy readings from the period within which the anomaly was formed (from within the stasis zone) report that there was a universe-universe interaction along the J-254 fractal seam at this location, causing a partial temporal transmission of an object, in this case, the life seed of a silicon based life form. The temporal signature of the Lillux Colossus seems to have been scrambled in its transmission, leading to an object still affected by its alternate universe's temporal position as long as it remains within AA-5542, though when it leaves, our time stream seems to reject it, leading to rapid oxidization and death for any part of the being brought outside.'

The general nature of extratemporal anomalies is not well understood, and thus most are discouraged from believing in them. Rumors such as the aforementioned Blinking Cow have a negative effect on research, as they can lead to a great deal of wasted effort and useless data. Thus, it is important that civilians be advised as to the truth of the nature of these anomalies, so they can help identify true cases from false.
