A common merchant loop, picking up rare-earth elements and musical instruments in [Gondar-2](Gondar-2), swapping rare earth elements for carbon-based foodstuffs on [Mizar-4](Mizar-4), refueling in the [Archipelago of the Damned](Archipelago of the Damned), swapping foodstuffs and instruments for mechanical tools and riding saddles at the [Turban of God](Turban of God), and finally returning the final leg of the journey back to [Gondar-2](Gondar-2).

The Loop is considered medium-risk by those in the know, but recent decreased demand for music on [Mizar-4](Mizar-4), and increased demand for reagents and scientific apparatus on Mizar-5 has lowered the popularity of the loop in favor of shorter, safer, and more profitable trading loops.
