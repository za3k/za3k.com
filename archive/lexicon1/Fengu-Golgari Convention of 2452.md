Fengu-Golgari Convention of 2452

The Fengu-Golgari Convention of 2452 is a set of intra-galactic rules and guidelines regulating the handling of xeno cultural heritage, to counteract the smuggling trade of artifacts along the edges of the [Archipelago of the Damned](Archipelago of the Damned) and ease military tensions between galactic powers claiming successor rights on neutral planets and systems. It includes regulations on the exchange of cultural artifacts, limits the extraction of artifacts of active Xeno cultures as well as strict rules about [Artifact Access Control](Artifact Access Control). The Fengu-Colgari Convention has since replaced the problematic and now defunct [Law of Finders Keepers](Law of Finders Keepers) that preceeded it.
