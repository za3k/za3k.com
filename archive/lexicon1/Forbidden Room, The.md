The Forbidden Room, the location of which is closely guarded by the IntraGalactic Astronomy Review Board, serves as a repository for all artifacts deemed too dangerous for standard access as prescribed via [Artifact Access Control](Artifact Access Control). The following stipulations exist for access should a member wish to study one of these artifacts:

- Form RSA-743 must be filled out in triplicate and submitted to the review board thirty (30) days in advance of any requested access.
- Access is to be limited to no more than one (1) hour per twenty-four (24) hour period, for no more than five (5) successive periods.
- If and when access is granted, the member and accompanying persons will be prohibited from accessing any artifacts relegated to the Forbidden Room for up to sixty (60) days after the last access period. 
- The member and any accompanying persons are required to have current Class-B or above [Sanity Certification](Sanity Certification). Class-C and/or Class-D certification may be required for specific artifacts, at the board's discretion.
- Members with [Psychic Attunement](Psychic Attunement) capabilities or suspected of psychic sensitivity are prohibited from accessing any part of the Forbidden Room. 
- The artifact is not to be removed from the viewing room - any equipment used to examine or test artifacts must be listed on the form and vetted by the review board to be brought onsite.
- No equipment may be used to copy, photograph or record any part of an artifact. Any and all transcriptions must be handwritten by the member or an accompanying scribe.
- Access may be denied at any time prior to or during the request period, for any reason, at the discretion of the review board. The review board is encouraged to revoke access immediately if the member begins to show signs of instability.
- Should the member refuse to leave once access is revoked or expired, or attempt to verify the location of the Forbidden Room, the board is authorized to deploy lethal force to secure the Forbidden Room and relegated artifacts.
