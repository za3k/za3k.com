A Cataphract was an intended spacecraft produced by the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire), although none ever escaped [Mizar-5](Mizar-5)’s outer atmosphere. They were crafted of metals harvested from fallen meteorites, and propelled by a modified [Balefyre Engine](Balefyre Engine). The Engine was modified in such a way that the pilot of the craft could psycho-kinetically control how exactly the Engine operated, such as the speed of fuel intake and compression. This was necessary because a Cataphract had little in the way of electrical instruments, and very few options otherwise to control the spacecraft’s flight.

It is estimated that there were a dozen or so attempts to escape Mizar-5’s atmosphere with a Cataphract, but as far as it is known, none succeeded. The attempts were likely limited by the rarity of the metals used and the rate in which [psychically-attuned](Psychic%20Attunement) Golgari reached the age of maturity. Most of the Cataphracts failed because of mental stress: the burden of controlling the spacecraft caused fatal cerebral hemorrhages in the pilots.

A perfectly preserved Cataphract can be observed in the [Denmortia Rainlands](Denmortia Rainlands), frozen in the air. It has yet to be more closely examined, because of the unique difficulties in reaching it.
