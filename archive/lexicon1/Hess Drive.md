The Hess Drive was a [ZZ-level](ZZ-level) artifact in [Kester City](Kester City). It was recorded destroyed in the Delijn Reactor Meltdown. All information about its purpose and correct operation was lost in the [Second Destruction of the Golgari Library](Second Destruction of the Golgari Library). Between the two disasters, information is sketchy. Our primary sources of information are Golgori historical records (always unreliable), and a single still frame of a schoolchild watching an educational program showing the Drive, found in an [Atemporal Anomaly](Atemporal Anomaly). Archeologists identify the markings on the object as first-millinium Kilt'iir (see [Kilt'iir, the](Kilt'iir, the)).

Study of the Hess Drive is believed to have led to Temporeactor technology (see [Delijn Reactor Meltdown, the](Delijn Reactor Meltdown, the), [Incandescent Temporeactor](Incandescent Temporeactor)), the temporal warp engine, the discovery of [Universe-Universe Binary Interaction](Universe-Universe Binary Interaction), the revised quantum-loop theory of [Psychic Attunement](Psychic Attunement), and the theory of progressive ergonomic adaption. Study of the Hess Drive caused the [Vvvelll Auto-genocide](Vvvelll Auto-genocide) (see, [Sanity Certification](Sanity Certification)). Rarely have so many civilizations been so profoundly impacted by single object.

The previous existence of the Drive was re-discovered by Joseph S. Hess II in RODS 56580a during routine digital archeology in the [Kester City](Kester City) pseudo-anamoly.
