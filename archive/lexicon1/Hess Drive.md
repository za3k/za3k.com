The Hess Drive was a [ZZ-level]] artifact in [Kester City]]. It was recorded destroyed in the Delijn Reactor Meltdown. All information about its purpose and correct operation was lost in the [Second Destruction of the Golgari Library]]. Between the two disasters, information is sketchy.

Study of the Hess Drive is believed to have led to Temporeactor technology (see [Delijn Reactor Meltdown, the]], [Incandescent Temporeactor]]), the temporal warp engine, the discovery of [Universe-Universe Binary Interaction]], the revised quantum-loop theory of [Psychic Attunement]], and the theory of progressive ergonomic adaption. Study of the Hess Drive caused the [[Vvvelll Auto-genocide]] (see, [[Sanity Certification](Delijn Reactor Meltdown, the]], [[Incandescent Temporeactor]]), the temporal warp engine, the discovery of [[Universe-Universe Binary Interaction]], the revised quantum-loop theory of [[Psychic Attunement]], and the theory of progressive ergonomic adaption.

The previous existence of the Drive was re-discovered by Joseph S. Hess II in RODS 56580a during routine digital archeology in the [Kester City](Kester City) pseudo-anamoly.
