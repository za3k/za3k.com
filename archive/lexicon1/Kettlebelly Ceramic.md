Kettlebelly Ceramic

Typus of burned ceramic bowls and vases of the early, pre-emperial Golgori culture ( see [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire)). They are easy to identify due to their characteristic features each of the ceramic containers shares with each other:

- Wide, almost spherical bottom, either with three small support legs or without
- Two to four handlebars, dents or other features near the rim that can be used to grip and carry the artifact
- A straight line (either painted on, dented in or prodding outwards) at the waistline of the container

42% of the Kettlebelly Ceramic found to this date also showed detailed motives of flora (even [Floramateria](Floramateria) on some occasions) and fauna, historical or mythological events and figures or what is assumed to be images of personal importance. That, and the fact that most have either been found underground or in great numbers opens the hypothesis that they had sigificant ritualistic importance, perhaps as burial urns, to contain sacred or sacrificial ingrediences or used in other important cultural events.

The name "Kettlebelly Ceramic" is a purely archeaological term, as the true cultural name of this type or ceramic wares has been erased from the historical records in the [Revisionist Period](Revisionist Period), like so many pre-emperial regional traditions and crafts that promote freedom of expression.
