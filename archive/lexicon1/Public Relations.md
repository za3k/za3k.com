The Public Relations department, headed by Thomas Collins, XPh., is a branch of The Order of the Preservation for Xenological History tasked with handling the perception of the preservation operation by the public. Its mission is threefold:

- To assuage the fears of the public about any of the more fantastical elements, like [[Psychic Attunement]] or [[B-Time]].
- To simultaneously discourage any interaction with potentially harmful artifacts, like a [[U-U Card]], except by members of the preservation operation.
- To encourage donations of resources, volunteering, or application to join the preservation operation.

Although the public-facing aspect of the department implies a low risk of sanity slippage, all members of the Public Relations department are nonetheless required to have Class-A or higher [[Sanity Certification]]. If you are interested in learning more about the Public Relations department, or joining the preservation effort, please contact the Director of Inquiries at serial 6JGH-34P-80MQ3

If the public ever found out the true purpose or extent of these operations, they'd be dissolved in a heartbeat. Don't ever let on to a nonmember or a newcomer what we're actually about. They'd never understand.
