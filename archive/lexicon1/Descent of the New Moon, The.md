The Descent of the New Moon was an event in Golgori year ⅟↋↊↋ↈ (RODS 456abc), subject to much debate over what the event was. As far as it is understood today, a small celestial object, most likely a moon or large meteor, appeared in the night sky over [Oedeon](Oedeon), the capital of the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire). How the object traveled or appeared there is not understood, but it slowly fell towards the surface of [Mizar-5](Mizar-5), impacting near dawn. The urban center and surrounding suburbs were completely obliterated, turned into glass or ash.

Various theories from elements on Mizar-5 have been proposed, none of them conclusive, but I shall list them here for the Order’s sake.

1. Divine punishment from [Zan-Taranth](Zan-Taranth), for their impiety. This is unconvincing, as Oedeon was home to the largest population of [Rotorastianites](https://lexicon.za3k.com/index.php/Rotorastrianism) in the Empire
2. Divine punishment from an entity other than Zan-Taranth, for their impiety. Proposed by some of the banned cults of the [New Golgori Rebellion](New Golgori Rebellion). Unlikely, for the above reasons.
3. Caused by elements at the [Institute for Psykologikal Masterie](Institute for Psykologikal Masterie), for it was relatively unscathed, the foundations of the building still standing in a landscape of glass. No known psychic has been shown to be able to summon celestial objects.
4. Research Station 6 claimed to have picked up the radio tags of [Varix Jhothar](Varix Jhothar)’s flagship *The Painted Bird* moments before the object appeared, which has led some to believe that the infamous captain lived and then proceeded to crash his ship into Mizar-5.

The only known non-Mizarian observance of the event was from a passing scrapper caravan in the [Archipelago of the Damned](Archipelago of the Damned), which tried to sell to me corrupted and otherwise unusable logs from their spectroscopes, claiming their instruments picked up light from the impact. The lack of reliable neutral confirmation of the event has led to a wide increase in belief of [Extratemporal Anomalies](Extratemporal Anomalies).
