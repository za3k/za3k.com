Endless Fabric

Traditional Golgori weaving tradition, in which the entire piece of clothing or other fabric-based product is made by a single thread, who's ends are intertwined at the completion of the work process, thereby completing an endless loop of fabric. Due to the intense manual labour and skill neccecary for this technique, the number of weavers still practising the art of Endless Fabric decreased drastically after the [[Industrial Ascendency]], as it cannot be reproduced via mechanised work. Teachings of this artform must have been purely through oral tradition as there are no written records speaking about the technical know-how that have been found to date. Experimental Archaeology has yet to recreate this unique weaving technique, an issue not helped by the severe restrictions of [[Artifact Access Control]].

Endless Fabric has been found in various artifacts made from plant fiber, animal hair, synthetic string and metal wire, and even hardened [[Varphorium]].
