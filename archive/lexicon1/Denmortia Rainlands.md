Denmortia Rainlands

Wide-stretching biome covering most of the equatorial landmass on [Mizar-5](Mizar-5). The year-around heat, combined with gathering clouds from the nearby oceans on both sides lead to an incredibly heavy and humid air that turns to gushing periods of rainfall numerous times almost every day of the year. The ground is heavily eroded, and the flora and fauna that inhabits this foggy marshland had to adapt heavily to survive a constant shortage of dry land, changing streams and waterlogged soil. Mangrove trees dominate the region, with wading birds, amphibians, insects and fish of all sizes thriving in this near untouched piece of nature. 

The lack of easily accessable ressources, habitable space for settlments and transportation as well as the high number of poisonous or disease-transmitting plants and animals lead to a severe lack of colonisation by the [Golgori Sovereign Empire](Golgori Sovereign Empire) or any other developed nation, although documents suggest that it may have been declared as a restricted military testing site for at least a few decades, evident through the crashed [Cataphract](Cataphract) hanging above its murky waters as well as a number of explosion craters. Small abandoned campsites with propaganda flyers, ammunition and reverse-engineered technology also point to several cells of the [New Golgari Rebellion](New Golgari Rebellion) using the hostile terrain as their hideout.
