Eldest Son is a contemporary retro-electropunk band that was formed in ESTDF June 6th, 6122. The band's music uses digitized instrumentals and vocals alongside analog brass and percussion instruments similar to those used in imperial ceremony to produce a sound described as "flavorfully historic, yet unambiguously modern in its chaotic signatures and stylized synth." The band derives its name and a portion of its imagery directly from [Elector-Prince Rzeszutko]], regarding the Empire's use of the mythology of the [Wax Witch](Elector-Prince Rzeszutko](Wax Witch](Elector-Prince Rzeszutko), regarding the Empire's use of the mythology of the [[Wax Witch) to cement the rule of the Rzeszutko dynasty. The band claims to take direct inspiration from the destruction of the cosmos prophesized by Rzeszutko, and that "...the entropic energy produced by the instruments of the apocalypse ushers in the inevitable end of the universe, culminating in a new era of divine primordial creation."

Although the group has performed dozens of times on multiple planets, the band has managed to keep the identity of its members a closely guarded secret, although some have theorized that like their namesake, the band's members are each multiple different people, rotating regularly to keep the sound fresh and ensure no two albums are alike. The group has found unusual popularity in the [Candaxx Loop]], owing somewhat to the route's ties to history and the band's persona. However, it also remains a cornerstone of electropunk culture in the area primarily because the band is one of the few that still releases their music on physical media, making it easier to acquire the music without needing to pass purchases through the [Galactic Hegemony of Associated Commerce and Trade](Candaxx Loop](Galactic Hegemony of Associated Commerce and Trade](Candaxx Loop), owing somewhat to the route's ties to history and the band's persona.
