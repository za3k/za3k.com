The Ionzhi Calendar was used in the [[Principality of Ionzh]] and the [[True Ionzhi Republic]]. It begins in 4014 local time (Real Ordinal Date Standard 44934e) and ends in year 5333 (Real Ordinal Date Standard 456333). Each local year corresponds to 4.0000034 mean local solar orbits in RODS 44934e. The epoch (year 0) of the Calendar seems to date from an unclear event before the existence of the Golgori, let alone the [[Golgori Sovereign Empire]]. The existence of a previous calendar seems likely but no historical evidence
 to support this theory has been disovered yet.
