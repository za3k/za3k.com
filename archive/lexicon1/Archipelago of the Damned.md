The Archipelago of the Damned is the informal name for the collection of planetoids orbiting a K-Class star in the [Rho-HY472](Rho-HY472) system. The cluster, so named for the cowardly Captain [Varix Jhothar](Varix Jhothar)'s untimely end, following shortly after his decisive defeat and hasty escape at the [Yozt Belt Skirmish](Yozt Belt Skirmish), consists of 47 planetoids and 183 moons. 

The system itself, although containing a few planetoids technically capable of supporting life, is found to be singularly uninhabitable - Varix' last verified correspondence from the planetoid [Gondar-2](Gondar-2) describes an unusually high number of vicious predatory species of flora and fauna - his remains have yet to be found. 

Most travelers through the system stop only to scoop fuel, but a few brave (and/or stupid) would-be explorers make an attempt to survive a period of time on one or more of these planetoids. The few who make it past warden patrols are usually never heard from again, and those that tell tales are careful not to reveal themselves when recounting.
