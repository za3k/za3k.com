The long-necked gh'dol is an endangered native species of [Mizar-5]]. It is most famous as a symbol of piety and obedience to the church in [Rotorastianism](Mizar-5](Rotorastianism](Mizar-5). It is most famous as a symbol of piety and obedience to the church in [[Rotorastianism). Rotorastians may display gh'dol banners, gh'dol symbolism on wooden furniture or plateware. The very wealthy or very eccentric may even keep live gh'dol in their house, though they are not ideal pets. Most representations of the gh'dol off Mizar-5 actually show the brilliant blue of the common (or "normal-necked") blue gh'dol, which survives better in captivity. The true long-necked gh'dol stands almost twice as tall, and has much duller off-white matte scales.

The long-necked gh'dol stands over 12 feet tall including the neck, but is very delicate, and flees from predators rather than fight back. It survives on insects, berries, and small solar-lizards. Like all gh'dol, it cannot truly fly, but only glide and swing from branch to branch. It makes a distinctive "Kii kii kii" call. While popular religious art shows the gh'dol as graceful (The "Divine Grace"), its movements could be more accurately described as slow.

The [Turban of God](Turban of God) is named after the long-necked gh'dol's characteristicly wrapped head-tongue.
