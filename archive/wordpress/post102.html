Metalexicon

I'm planning on running an "alternative metahistory" game in three levels, with two groups (potentially three if we're crowded) of players.  This is an experiment with canon, the history of history, and recontextualization.

The overview of the game is that it consists of three subgames.   I will explain them here, initially in a sequential format.  If you haven't read the last post explaining the game of Lexicon, do so now.
<ol>
    <li>The first group of players (the Historians) will play a game of Lexicon, describing a situation somehow affecting their present.</li>
    <li>The second group of players (the Metahistorians) will play a <em>different</em> group of historians in the future of the world described by the first group.  Their work is the study of the Historian group, examining their biases, historical inaccuracy, and generally explaining why and how they managed to get everything all wrong.  They will write a metahistorical work, annotating the original lexicon (the Annotations).  The second group is for some reason better aware of what was <strong>actually</strong> going on, and explains this at length.  For an interesting 'historical' bent to change creative processes, the second group of players will have the Lexicon gradually revealed as more historical evidence is 'dug up'.</li>
    <li>The third group of players will play a simple RPG set in the same time period as the first group.  They will have access to the unannotated Lexicon created by the first group, but the lexicon created by the second group will be treated as describing the actual state of the RPG world.</li>
</ol>
I played with various interesting ways to set up the groups, including collapsing groups, running things simultaneously, and messing with information flow.  I decided one week- to month-long worldbuilding phase with two groups (1+2), and an indefinite-length RPG running with one of the two groups afterwards (3):
<ol>
    <li>First, one group of players (the Historians), will play Lexicon.</li>
    <li>Second, the Metahistorians will play a simultaneous game of Metalexicon with the first Lexicon as source material, creating the Annotations or Metahistory.  The Lexicon will be released to them on a slightly delayed basis (probably three days or so) to allow for some groups skipping days.</li>
    <li>I think the most fun option for the RPG is to have the original Historians play after the Annotations are completed, with the gamemaster having read the Annotations.</li>
</ol>
