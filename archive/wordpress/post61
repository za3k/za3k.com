(Not Currently) At Work

For the past three months or so I've been programming 99% of the time in C++ (I had a recent excursion to perl to autogenerate some code).

I now know much, much more than I ever expected or wanted to know about C++.  To give you a sample, here are the books I bought for work:
<ul>
    <li>Design Patterns, by Gamma et. al.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612</a></li>
    <li>C++ Template Metaprogramming<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321227255">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321227255</a></li>
    <li>Boost<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321133544">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321133544</a></li>
    <li>The C++ Programming Language, by Bjarne Stroustrup<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735">
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201700735</a></li>
    <li>O'Reiley STL Pocket Reference<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596005563">

</ul>
Also, I plan to learn Ruby, but I'm having trouble finding a good tutorial (that is, a tutorial for non-beginners).  Please comment with any recommendations.
