Hello, world (draft)
<p>
Hi, everyone... if anyone that is.  My name is Gabriel, and this is my tscroll.  Since everyone else I know is getting one I decided I could as well.  We'll see how long it lasts.  Sorry if it doesn't look good, I don't truly comprehend this net thing yet.  Don't expect anything profound here, I just plan to rant and rave as most people.  If you don't know me it shouldn't be anything special, and even then it's edgy.

I went to the market today, finally.  I picked up some juice and utensils.  Not at all exciting.  Managed to spend u30 somehow, eek.  Tonight I lay upon the hill by the mana tower.  I was spread out upon my jacket, and pure gazing down into the inky depths of the sky, watching the occasional starfish pass by.  The elephant was the only constellation I recognized, and I might be faking that.  It feels a long time since I took a break. Life seems so fast lately, even when nothing much is happening.  I need to slow down more often.  Maybe I will join Wirt in his meditation next time.

Stillview is of the Landans' council next to the hill.  Sorry for the bad angle.
