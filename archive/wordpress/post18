Simuraculum (draft)

So some friends and I went down to the Simuraculum today.  I admit, I'm pretty geeky, and proud of it.  I play a priest.  I was happy that my preparations all turned out to be of use today.  Unfortunately, I lost my old record and had to write a new one ahead of time.  I'm hoping I find the old one, because it's in the same place as my scry amplifier.  Anyway, the session was quite enjoyable and I felt a probably inappropriate amount of adrenaline.  That is, some.

On an unrelated note, I missed my "Applied Theory" circle this morning.  I feel so dumb, I was just thinking it was on the 4th instead of the 2nd.  And this is the subject I'm retaking.  Terrible.

Well, I'm going to go and practice indirect reference geomancy now.  I've been falling a bit behind.  Bye all.
