I live.

So, I've always made sure on this blog to post on a strict basis of "when I have something interesting to say", which means it didn't get updated often.  However, the last year or two has been tremendously exciting for me, and I've done lots of self-experimentation, learning, research, and even my personal life might be interesting to blog about.  In fact, I've been so distracted, I didn't blog about any of it.

I've spent a lot of my time lately relating what I've been doing to other people, so I guess that people find it interesting.  In an effort to save time, and so people not in my immediate social circle can get my experimental data, I'm going to try to debrief--post all of this backlog online.  Probably the hardest part will be coming up with a list of topics, so if there's anything I should blog about, contact me or add a comment with the topic here.
