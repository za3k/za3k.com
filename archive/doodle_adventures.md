## how to play

- pass out paper and pencil to everyone
- print out one of the adventures below. you can read the one-line summary at the top to pick one you like, but don't read the rest yet!
- slowly reveal the events one at a time. you can hide them with a piece of paper you slide down, or you can just have one player read them out loud without sneaking a peek ahead.
- as each event is revealed, do whatever it says.
- when the event tells you to draw something, you draw it on a new piece of paper. i recommend drawings take 1-3 minutes each, but you can take as long as everyone wants really.
- you usually write what the drawing is of. just use 1-3 words.
- that's it!

## making your own adventures

- you can make your own adventures however you want, but play one or two of the ones below to get a feel for how they go first. 
- i don't have a great way to make and play adventures one-player yet. 
- if you write your own adventure, feel free to send it to me and I can add it here.
- if you want to make and play and adventure as a group, here's one way.

1. Write the numbers 1-8 (or however many drawings you want.
2. One player says what the story is about, and says out loud what that is.
3. The next player writes the first step, but doesn't show it to everyone.
4. They pass the paper to the next player, who writes step 2, and folds the paper so only step 2 is visible.
5. The player after that sees only step 2. They write step 3, and fold the paper again so only step 3 is visible. Keep going until the story is done and you have 6-8 steps.
6. Now play like normal.
