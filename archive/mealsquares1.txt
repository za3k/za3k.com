Here is the 1.0 recipe if you're interested in making it:

24 mealsquares
(4 square silicone candy molds from Michael's https://www.michaels.com/product/6-pack-square-silicone-candy-mold-by-celebrate-it-MP477416 )
Date syrup:
over low heat, combine
225g Date paste
120g Vegetable glycerin
and stir until homogenous
can add a small amount of water for consistency depending

Liquid:
5 eggs
1.5oz Orange juice concentrate
2 cups Evaporated milk
100g Applesauce (unsweetened)
100g Pumpkin puree
135g Coconut oil
77g Olive oil

Mix together with
Dry:
500g Oat flour
300g Whey protein concentrate (unflavored)
200g Chocolate chips
160g Sunflower seeds
135g Rice bran
85g Carrot powder
20g Garbanzo bean flour
25g Iodized salt
5g Sunflower lecithin
5g Pumpkin spice
2g Baking soda or 8g Baking powder (warning! Baking sodas vary quite a bit by brand and whether it includes aluminum, we used the less potent aluminum free baking soda for mealsquares, experimentation needed for small batches.)

Optional:
15g Potassium citrate (can be omitted for small hit to potassium content)
D3+K2 drops (varies by brand, add enough for ~500% your DRI since this is about 5 days of Mealsquares)
Liquid calcium folinate (same as above)
Niacinamide (same as above)
Lactase (added to condensed milk if lactose intolerant)
Add (small amounts) liquid water if consistency is too thick. Should be like peanut butter or slightly thicker.

Bake at 350, time varies wildly by oven design, and edges may overcook while centers undercook. You will likely need to pull them out of the oven at the 2/3 baking point and flip the molds around to avoid this and get even results.

Packaging: remove as much air as possible to avoid them going stale in the fridge.

This recipe could likely be optimized with the substitutions of some milk protein powder for condensed milk and some tapioca syrup for vegetable glycerin. These optimizations were only discovered as we were moving towards production of Mealsquares 2.0 so were never implemented in 1.0. Would require experimentation for water content and baking times etc.
