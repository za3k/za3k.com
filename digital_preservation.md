I am a hobbyist archiver. As such, I already keep backups of a very large number of very large files. A few extra are not a big bother. Here are some services I can offer acquaintances for free:

- I can take your backup/files, and put it on my computer. If you want to update your backup, I can rsync it regularly.
- I can take your backup/files (on a hard drive) and put it in my closet.
- I can download or upload large datasets for you. I have fast, unmetered bandwidth.
- I can copy large datasets for you. You will need to pay for drives or give me blank drives. Direct disk (block) copy is *much* easier, but I can copy contents if needed.
- I can mail stuff to you, if you can't pick it up in person (for example, if you move to another state, and then disaster strikes and you need the backup in my closet).
- I can host some files for you, so other people can access them online. The files need to be totally static (never change) or you need to provide a mirror I can sync with.
- I can back up your website on a regular basis.
- I can offer most of the above from the 1KB-20TB range.
- I can store various documents and release them under some condition. Common conditions are "if I ask for them", "if someone else asks for them", "if I'm dead", or "if I disappear from the internet". We can talk and design a reasonable set of conditions. Dead-you stuff should be standard will stuff where you don't trust a lawyer to get the tech part right, like releasing your Facebook password to your next of kin. 
- I make a best effort to preserve something and make it public online as long as I can. Think back issues of a defunct magazine--small stuff.

Here are some services I don't provide
- I will not host your website, unless it is totally static and doesn't update.
- I will not teach you how to make or host a website, but I recommend Github Pages.
- I will not archive a website for you. But if you archive it, I can store the archive.
- I will not provide any of the services above to strangers for free.
- Please *do not* ask me to do anything (release documents, etc) for you after your suicide. It will emotionally wreck me.
- I can not guarantee any of your data remains private or undeleted in the face of thugs or the law. If a bunch of people show up at my house and threaten me, I'm giving your stuff to them. Encrypt it and don't give me the key if you want a security guarantee.
