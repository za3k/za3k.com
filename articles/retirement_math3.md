In [part one](/articles/retirement_math1), I walked you through how people imagine the math works to retire early. We need to make a ton of money, or spend almost nothing.
In [part two](/articles/retirement_math2), I talked through retiring *forever*, using the real math. It only took a little longer than retiring until 80 with the fake math.

So we're good now, right? Imaginary-us saves up 500K in the stock market, makes $20K/year, and can retire forever?

Well, there is a caveat. You need an additional safety margin, even if the stock market doesn't collapse. You probably want to retire in 15 years, not 12.5.

- Imagine your balance was "only" 400K, rather than 500K. Now you make 16K investment income each year. You still spend $20K each year. So you're now losing $4K per year! 25 years later your balance hits 300K, and you're losing $8k per year. It "snowballs" down exponentially until your savings hit zero, although fairly slowly at first (40 years to go broke).
- Imagine your balance was all the way up at $600K. You make $24K investment income each year. You still spend $20K each year. So now you're making $4K per year. 25 years later your balance hits 700K, and you're making $8K per year. It "snowballs" up exponentially instead, and you just make more and more money indefinitely. Also slowly at first.
- So there's this "magic" line at 500K. If you're above $500K, you expect your savings to grow forever with no work. If you're below $500K, you expect it to shrink forever unless you get a job.
- The 4% per year from the stock market is an average. Stocks don't actually make 4% per year--they make 20%, 1%, lose money, whatever. So in practice, your bank balance is going up and down the whole time. That means if you're close to $500K, whether it snowballs up or down is basically random based on the first couple years. You want to have more like $600K instead, so you definitely snowball up, even if the stocks do badly for a year or two.
- There's another advantage to "snowballing" up. If you start making $25K, you can spend $22K now and still make money. The rich literally get richer with no work. Another reason to aim a little high--you want to enjoy retirement!

To summarize, if you live on $20K/year, and work at $60K/year, you can retire indefinitely in theory, after 12.5. In practice, add a safety margin. Now you're secure against random stock market problems, and you make *more money* over time.

Okay, but you don't want to retire forever. You're not immortal[^2]. Can you retire even earlier? Yes.
