In [part one](/articles/retirement_math1), I walked you through how people imagine the math works to retire early. We need to make a ton of money, or spend almost nothing.
In [part two](/articles/retirement_math2), I talked through retiring *forever*, using the real math. It only took a little longer than retiring until 80 with the fake math.
In [part three](/articles/retirement_math3), I explained about *snowballing up* and *snowballing down*, and why you might want to save more than the bare minimum.

In this part, we'll talk about how people don't live forever, except for you.

From [part two](/articles/retirement_math2), our rough estimate formula to retire was that it took: **25 * expenses / (income - expenses)** years. Let's plug in some numbers.

Now let's say you make $50K/year, and spend $40K/year. The same math says it will take you 25 * 40K / (50K-40K) = 1,000K / 10K = 100 years to retire. You will never be able to retire indefinitely; you'll die first. That is a huge difference from previous examples. What gives? That's a pretty typical person, right? Why is everyone not starving on the street at 80? Let's take a quick digression.

### Normal retirement
In practice of course people do spend a lot of what they make and then retire. There are many reasons. 
- The formulas assume you're going to retire indefinitely. Actually, you only need enough money until you die. It's a 2.2X difference, if you retire at 65. That's a 55% discount for being mortal. We'll talk about the specifics below.
- People just retire. They're going to, frankly whether they can afford it or not. Some people retire at 65 because they're told they can or should, or they feel they deserve it. Even past that point, others can't work starting at a certain age.
- Some people just go broke. Some go back to work, some starve on the street when they can't. It does happen. You can retire when it was a bad idea.
- Beyond that, some people realize they don't have enough money, and cut back significantly. The imaginary people in my head do this when they're running out of money, not immediately when they retire. Cutting back may or may not fix the problem.
- Most people in the US have special retirement accounts, which they must or are heavily encouraged to pay into. Employers may "match" retirement money (paying an equal share), or it may have special untaxed status. Usually you can't take money out of a retirement account until you're 65, to force people to actually use them for retirement. The account may also be designed so you can't take all the money out at once even after that point.
- The USA has governement programs to help. Medicare provides free health care for almost every old person. Social Security sends monthly checks to old retired people, although rarely enough to live on comfortably.
- We have social support programs. Families often support older relatives. Churches and other social groups can offer help too (as well as for broke and poor people).

If you're retiring at 30, almost **none** of the above apply to you. You need to get by on savings, no external support. You don't get a 55% mortality discount on retirement, you get a measly 15% discount. You probably don't have much in your standard retirement account, and even if you do, you can't access it for another 35 years. You don't get medicare (though you *may* get medicaid). You don't get social security. Expect no social support. If people see a healthy 50-year old go broke from poor retirement planning, they should tell you to get a job. I would.

### Mortality discounts

I mentioned we get a "mortality discount". That is, to retire for 50 years is easier than retiring forever. Makes sense.

Most people guess the math is, you need to save up **expenses x years**. The actual correct equation is **25 x expenses x (1 - e^(-0.04 * years you want to retire))**. They're pretty different.

Some example numbers:
- To retire for 15 years (at 65), you need 11 times your yearly expenses (not 15 times). That's a 24% discount over the simple math.
- To retire for 25 years (at 55), you need 16 times your yearly expenses. That's a 36% discount.
- To retire for 35 years (at 45), you need 19 times your yearly expenses. That's a 46% discount.
- To retire for 45 years (at 35), you need 21 times your yearly expenses. That's a 53% discount.
- To retire for 55 years (at 25), you need 22 times your yearly expenses. That's a 60% discount.
- To retire at any age and live forever, you need 25 times your yearly expenses. Technically, that's a 100% discount, because the simple math says we need infinity dollars.

In other words, if you can retire early, you need *way less money* to do it. That's a good reason all on its own.
