I retired at 31, which is pretty unusual. And I get asked about it a fair deal (and even more people want to ask but are too polite). So I wanted to go ahead and answer "how did you retire early?". The basic answer is
 - I made a bunch of money
 - I don't spend much
 - Math

Even reasonable people people imagine the wrong specifics for all three, though. I'll walk you through it. We'll start with the math, which is the most surprising to most people.

Here's how people *imagine* the math will work.

Imagine you're currently 20. You plan to live until 80, then die [^1]. You make $60K/year, and spend $50K/year. 

That's enough to retire at 65. How can you improve that to retiring at 30?

There are two common approaches. The more common assumption is the "high income", or "fixed expenses" method:
- You spend $50K/year.
- You want to retire from 30 to 80, for 50 years.
- You need $50K/year x 50 years = $2500 for retirement. That's $2.5 million.
- Therefore, to make that by retirement you need to make $2500K / 10 years = $250K/year.
- So you need to increase your income to $250/year.

The second common approach is the "low expenses", or "fixed income" method:
- You make $60K/year.
- You will retire in 10 years.
- When you retire, you will have made $60K/year x 10 years = $600K.
- You need that to last you your remaining life, from 20 to 80. That's 60 years.
- You need to spend $600K / 60 years = $10K/year.
- So you need to decrease your expenses to $10K/year.

So you can increase your income, or decrease your spending, or do some combination of both. This basic insight is correct.

But all the numbers are *wrong*. The math is *incorrect*. If you retire at 65, it's a *little wrong*, but if you retire at 30 it's *wildly wrong*. A new factor dominates when retiring at 30 or 40.

[^1]: Not, you know, that people *plan* to die at 80. They don't circle a date in their calendar. But you have to know how long you'll be retired to plan financially. Actually, living to 100 can turn into a financial problem, because you've run out of savings. This is part of how insurance [got started](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tontine).
