This page was originally hosted [here](http://www.natomic.com/hosted/marks/mpat/) but has since gone down. I've archived it on my site. Thank you Mark for writing the tutorial, and thanks to the [Wayback Machine][] for keeping it around for me to copy. Sorry my version looks terrible!

Hello! Welcome to Mark's Pixel Art Tutorial. I hope you will find some useful information here. 
This guide is intended for those new to working with pixels - if you already know what you're doing, you shouldn't be here! 
I make no claims to be an authority on pixel art. Everyone has their own preferred style - for alternative tutorials and work from other artists, check out the [links](mark_links.md) section.
